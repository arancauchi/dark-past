# Writing Style Guide

Voice and rhythm guidelines for dark history scripts.

---

## Sentence Rhythm

**Vary sentence length.** Don't over-rely on staccato.

Short punchy sentences are for **emphasis moments only** — deaths, reveals, betrayals. If every sentence is short, none of them hit.

**Bad (constant staccato):**
```
The ship sank. They swam to shore. There was no food. No water. No shelter. They were alone. No one knew. No one came.
```

**Good (varied rhythm):**
```
The ship sank. The survivors swam to shore and took stock of what remained: no food, no fresh water, no shelter. Just sand, rock, and the endless ocean in every direction.

And no one knew they were there.
```

The final line hits because the paragraph before it earned the pause.

---

## Emphasis Lines

Let important lines **breathe**. Give them their own paragraph.

```
Chaumareys didn't hesitate. Cut the ropes.
```

```
They were never seen again.
```

```
He never looked back. Not once.
```

These work because they're isolated. If buried in a paragraph, they lose impact.

---

## Active Voice for Action

Use active voice for violence, decisions, and action sequences.

**Weak (passive):**
```
The prisoners were dragged onto the deck, where they were clubbed to death.
```

**Stronger (active):**
```
The Maori dragged the cowering Europeans onto the deck and clubbed them to death, one by one.
```

Passive voice is acceptable for context and setup, but switch to active when the violence starts.

---

## Numbers

State numbers plainly. Don't bury them.

```
150 people boarded that raft. 15 were rescued.
```

```
Eighty people were abandoned on that island. Seven survived.
```

Numbers create stakes. Let them land.

---

## Direct Address

Use sparingly for emotional beats. Once or twice per script maximum.

```
Imagine watching that. Twelve years of waiting. And the ship just... leaves.
```

```
We can only imagine the terror that gripped the survivors.
```

Overuse breaks immersion. Reserve for moments where you want the viewer to feel it personally.

---

## Quotes

Include survivor/historical quotes when available. They add authenticity and hit differently than narration.

```
In the words of one survivor: "Those whom death had spared fell upon the dead bodies and cut off pieces, which some instantly devoured."
```

```
One British sergeant was said to have shouted back: "Not bloody likely!"
```

Quotes should be visceral or memorable. Don't quote mundane observations.

---

## Section Endings

End sections on a punch, not flat information.

**Weak ending:**
```
The army continued its march toward Kabul.
```

**Strong ending:**
```
They had no way of knowing that their fate had already been sealed — by a man who had never set foot on the island.
```

Every section break is a potential drop-off point. Give viewers a reason to stay.

---

## Avoid

- **Constant staccato** — Exhausting to listen to, numbs the impact
- **"This is the dark story of X"** — Generic, weak
- **Overly poetic openings** — Abstract language loses morbid curiosity viewers
- **Passive voice during action** — Drains energy from violence
- **Long unbroken paragraphs** — Hard to follow when narrated
- **Burying the horror** — If the best moment is at minute 10, most viewers won't see it

## Checklist

Before finalizing a script:

- [ ] Are punchy sentences reserved for emphasis, not constant?
- [ ] Do important lines have their own paragraph?
- [ ] Is action written in active voice?
- [ ] Do numbers land clearly?
- [ ] Does every section end on a punch?
- [ ] Is direct address used sparingly (1-2x max)?
- [ ] Are quotes visceral or memorable?
