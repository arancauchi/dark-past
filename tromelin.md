COLD OPEN

In 1761, eighty people were abandoned on a tiny island in the Indian Ocean.

They weren't passengers. They were cargo.

When the ship sank, half of them drowned in the cargo hold — chained together, clawing at walls they couldn't see as the water rose past their waists, their chests, their mouths.

The survivors made it to shore. Built a fire. Waited for rescue.

One man knew exactly where they were. He refused to send a ship — not because he couldn't, but because he wanted someone to pay for a dead man's crime.

They would wait fifteen years.

Every man who tried to leave that island disappeared. The women who stayed were the only ones who survived.

As always, viewer discretion is advised.

ACT 1: THE WRECK

In 1761, a French captain named Jean de La Fargue was given a simple mission: sail to Madagascar, pick up rice and beef, and bring it back.

But La Fargue saw an opportunity.

On Madagascar, he loaded 160 men, women, and children into the cargo hold. Slaves - to be sold illegally at the next port.

The governor of the Isle of France had banned the slave trade. La Fargue didn't care. The profit was too good.

It was a decision that would leave eighty people to die.

To avoid detection, he took a shortcut through unfamiliar waters - at night, without accurate maps.

The sea was black. No moon. The only light came from the ship's lanterns, swaying with each wave.

On July 31st, the ship struck a reef.

The hull split open. Water rushed in.

The French crew scrambled onto the deck and swam for the nearby sandbar.

Below deck, the slaves heard the crash. They felt the ship lurch. Then the water came - pouring through the splintered hull, rising fast in the darkness.

They were chained in the cargo hold. As the water climbed past their ankles, their knees, their waists, they had nowhere to go. Some tried to break free. Some screamed for help that wasn't coming.

Half of them drowned in that hold, tangled in their chains, clawing at walls they couldn't see.

By morning, the survivors took stock.

Around 120 French sailors had made it to shore. So had 80 of the slaves.

They were stranded on an island barely a kilometer wide. A flat strip of sand and coral, baking under the tropical sun. No trees. No fresh water. No shelter. Just sand, rock, and the endless ocean in every direction.

And no one knew they were there.

But the survivors weren't ready to die. Not yet.

---

ACT 2: THE ABANDONMENT

For the next two months, everyone worked.

The French salvaged wood from the wreck. Built a forge. Constructed tools. And piece by piece, they built a boat.

The slaves worked alongside them — hauling timber, digging wells, watching the boat take shape plank by plank.

They must have known. The boat was too small. There would never be room for everyone. But they kept working. What choice did they have?

On September 27th, 1761, the sailors loaded their supplies and climbed aboard. Every Frenchman. Every one.

The slaves gathered on the beach to watch. The morning sun already hot on their backs.

The first mate looked back at them.

"We'll send a ship," he said. "We'll come back for you."

Then they sailed away.

The eighty men, women, and children left on the beach watched the boat grow smaller.

And smaller.

Until it disappeared over the horizon.

They had no way of knowing if the promise was real. No way of knowing if anyone would come.

So they waited.

They had no way of knowing that their fate had already been sealed - by a man who had never set foot on the island.

---

ACT 3: THE REFUSAL

The French boat reached Madagascar four days later.

Captain La Fargue didn't make it. He died during the crossing.

The first mate, Barthélémy Castellan, went straight to the governor of the Isle of France.

He told him about the wreck. About the promise he had made. About the eighty people still stranded.

The governor listened from behind his desk. His expression never changed.

Then he refused.

La Fargue had smuggled slaves against his direct orders. La Fargue had embarrassed him. And now La Fargue was conveniently dead — beyond punishment.

Someone had to pay.

The governor would not send a ship. Not now. Not ever.

Barthélémy begged, wrote letters, pleaded with anyone who would listen.

The answer was always the same: No.

On the island, eighty people waited for a rescue that would never come.

---

ACT 4: SURVIVAL

The first months were the hardest.

No trees meant no wood for shelter. No fresh water meant digging wells in the sand and praying for rain.

The survivors built huts from coral and stone. They wove clothing from seabird feathers. They ate turtles, fish, and whatever birds they could catch.

And every single day, they kept a fire burning on the beach. Someone had to tend it through the night. For fifteen years, they never let it die.

Months passed. Then years.

Early on, eighteen men built a raft from the remaining wreckage and set out for Madagascar. They said they would send help.

They were never seen again.

The population dwindled - disease, starvation, despair. Some simply lost the will to live.

By the third year, only fifteen people were left alive.

Year four passed. Then five. Then ten. The world forgot them. But they kept the fire burning.

Then, in 1773 - twelve years after the wreck - a ship appeared on the horizon.

For the first time in over a decade, rescue had come.

The survivors screamed, waved, fed the fire until smoke billowed into the sky.

The ship circled the island, searching for a way through the reef.

It couldn't find one. It sailed away.

Imagine watching that. Twelve years of waiting. And the ship just... leaves.

A second ship came months later. Same result. It anchored offshore, close enough to see, too far to reach.

But this time, a sailor dove into the water and swam to the island.

He made it to shore. Now he was stuck there too - one of them.

Together, they built another raft. The sailor, three men, and three women climbed aboard and pushed off toward the horizon.

The remaining survivors watched from the beach.

The raft grew smaller. And smaller.

It vanished. Just like the first raft. Just like everyone who tried to leave.

Seven people remained on the island.

They went back to the fire. And they waited.

ACT 5: THE RESCUE

On November 29th, 1776 - fifteen years after the wreck - a French corvette named La Dauphine finally made it through the reef.

Captain Jacques de Tromelin stepped onto the sand.

What he found stunned him.

Seven women. And an eight-month-old baby.

They were thin. Weathered. Dressed in woven feathers — clothes they had made themselves when the last fabric rotted away years ago.

And the fire was still burning.

Fifteen years. Every single day. They had kept it alive.

Of the eighty people abandoned here, these seven women were all that remained.

Every man was gone.

Captain Tromelin brought them aboard his ship and sailed for Mauritius.

When they arrived, the new governor - a different man than the one who had condemned them - declared them free.

They were offered passage back to Madagascar.

Semiavou refused. She was afraid of being enslaved again.

Fifteen years on that island, and she still trusted strangers less than she trusted the sand.

The governor took three of them into his own home: Semiavou, her mother, and her baby. Three generations of survivors.

They named the baby Jacques — after the captain who saved them.

---

OUTRO

The governor who refused to send a rescue was never punished.

Barthélémy Castellan - the first mate who promised to come back - spent fifteen years fighting to make it happen. He petitioned every official who would meet with him. By the time anyone actually rescued them, it was too late for most of them.

In 1781, the philosopher Condorcet wrote about Tromelin. He called what happened there "a crime of lese-humanity" - a crime against all of mankind.

Eighty people were abandoned on that island.

Half had already drowned in chains.

The rest were left to die for someone else's crime.

Seven survived.

Today, the island is named Tromelin - after the captain who rescued them.

Not after the people who kept a fire burning for fifteen years.

Not after Semiavou. Not after the women who outlasted everyone.

After the man who finally showed up.
