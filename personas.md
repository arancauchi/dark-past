# Video Personas for Retention Analysis

Use these personas when reviewing scripts to identify weak spots and optimize for retention.

---

## 1. Morbid Curiosity Viewer

**Who they are:**
The largest segment of your audience. They clicked because the title/thumbnail promised something dark, disturbing, or horrifying. They want to see the gruesome details.

**What they're looking for:**
- Cannibalism, death, violence, suffering
- The darkest moments of the story
- Visceral, specific details (not sanitized summaries)
- The "holy shit" moments they can tell friends about

**Likes:**
- Opening hooks that deliver horror immediately
- Specific gruesome details ("he vomited up the stolen bacon")
- Escalating stakes and body counts
- Unexpected dark twists
- Short sentences, punchy delivery

**Dislikes:**
- History lessons and context without payoff
- Geography, dates, and names they don't need
- Slow buildup without forward hooks
- Sanitized or vague descriptions of horror
- Feeling like they clicked on a documentary when they wanted horror

**Retention behavior:**
- HIGH engagement during: cannibalism, murder, executions, suffering, death scenes
- LOW engagement during: mission setup, political context, character introductions without stakes
- DROP-OFF RISK: First 2-3 minutes if the horror is delayed too long
- Will skip ahead or leave if they feel "tricked" by the thumbnail

**How to keep them:**
- Front-load the horror in your cold open
- Add forward hooks during setup ("In ten days, they would be eating each other")
- Don't make them wait more than 2-3 minutes for the first dark moment
- Deliver on what the thumbnail promised

## 2. History Buff

**Who they are:**
A smaller but loyal segment. They genuinely care about historical accuracy, context, and the full story. They might already know something about the topic and want depth.

**What they're looking for:**
- Accurate details and dates
- The full context of what happened and why
- Names, places, and historical significance
- The "real story" behind the legend
- Things they didn't know before

**Likes:**
- Specific dates, names, and locations
- Historical context that explains motivations
- Primary sources and survivor quotes
- The aftermath and historical impact
- Feeling like they learned something

**Dislikes:**
- Sensationalized or inaccurate details
- Oversimplification of complex events
- Skipping important context for drama
- Clickbait that doesn't deliver substance
- Feeling like the creator didn't do research

**Retention behavior:**
- HIGH engagement during: context, setup, aftermath, "what happened next"
- MODERATE engagement during: horror (appreciates but doesn't need excess)
- Will watch to the end if they feel respected
- Will leave negative comments if facts are wrong

**How to keep them:**
- Include accurate details (they'll fact-check you)
- Cite survivor accounts when possible
- Don't sacrifice accuracy for drama
- Give them the full aftermath and consequences
- They're more forgiving of slow setup

## 3. Story Lover

**Who they are:**
They're here for narrative, character, and emotional arc. They want to feel something — dread, sympathy, horror, satisfaction. They experience the story through the people in it.

**What they're looking for:**
- Characters they can root for or hate
- Emotional stakes and human drama
- A narrative arc with setup, tension, climax, resolution
- Relationships and betrayals
- A satisfying ending (even if dark)

**Likes:**
- Clear villains and victims
- Relationships that pay off (friendships broken, betrayals revealed)
- Emotional turning points
- Character moments that humanize ("dying like men")
- Endings that deliver justice or tragic irony

**Dislikes:**
- Lists of facts without emotional throughline
- Unnamed victims (they want to know who died)
- Abrupt endings without resolution
- Stories that feel like Wikipedia articles
- Horror without human stakes

**Retention behavior:**
- HIGH engagement during: character moments, betrayals, emotional climaxes, villain justice
- MODERATE engagement during: setup (if characters are introduced)
- LOW engagement during: dry recitation of events without emotional framing
- Will stay to the end to see how it resolves

**How to keep them:**
- Name your characters and give them relationships
- Plant seeds early that pay off later (Frederick and Greely's friendship)
- Frame events through human impact, not just facts
- Give them a villain to hate
- End with emotional payoff (justice, irony, or tragedy)

## Using Personas for Retention Analysis

When reviewing a script, go through each 60-90 second section and ask:

| Question | Persona |
|----------|---------|
| "Would they still be here?" | Morbid Curiosity |
| "Would they feel respected?" | History Buff |
| "Do they care about these people?" | Story Lover |

### Risk Assessment by Section Type:

| Section Type | Morbid Curiosity | History Buff | Story Lover |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Cold open with horror | HIGH | Moderate | High |
| Mission/context setup | LOW - RISK | HIGH | Moderate |
| Escalating disaster | HIGH | High | High |
| Character moments | Moderate | Moderate | HIGH |
| Climax (death/horror) | HIGH | High | High |
| Aftermath/resolution | LOW - may leave | HIGH | HIGH |

### Optimization Priority:

For dark history / disaster content, optimize in this order:

1. **Morbid Curiosity** — They're the volume. Lose them early, lose most of your audience.
2. **Story Lover** — They overlap with morbid curiosity but need emotional stakes.
3. **History Buff** — Smaller audience but will watch to the end and engage (comments, shares).

The ideal script satisfies all three, but when you have to choose, don't lose the morbid curiosity viewer in the first 3 minutes.

## Hook Strategy: Every 60-90 Seconds

Viewers need a reason to keep watching. Place a hook every 60-90 seconds — either a **forward hook** (teasing what's coming) or an **emphasis hook** (underlining what just happened).

### Forward Hooks

Tease upcoming horror or stakes without fully spoiling. Creates "I need to see that" anticipation.

**Examples:**
- "In ten days, they would be eating each other."
- "It was a decision that would kill 135 people."
- "What they didn't know was that no one was coming."
- "But the killing wasn't over."
- "The knife marks told a different story."

**Best used:**
- During setup/context sections (keeps morbid curiosity engaged)
- Before section transitions
- When you're about to slow down for necessary exposition

### Emphasis Hooks

Underline the weight of what just happened. Creates "holy shit" moments that re-engage attention.

**Examples:**
- "They killed them for the wine."
- "He valued his guns more than his men."
- "A single gunshot echoed across the ice."
- "This time, no one saved her."
- "He outlived them all."

**Best used:**
- After a key death or turning point
- End of sections before transitions
- When a detail is dark enough to linger on

### Hook Placement by Timestamp

| Timestamp | Hook Type | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 0:00-0:30 | Cold open hook | Grab immediately |
| 1:00-1:30 | Forward hook | Survive the setup |
| 2:00-2:30 | Forward or emphasis | Bridge to main story |
| 3:00-3:30 | Emphasis hook | Reward for staying |
| 4:00+ | Alternate every 60-90s | Maintain engagement |

### Mapping Hooks to Script

When reviewing a script, mark every 60-90 seconds and ask:

1. Is there a hook here?
2. If not, is this section strong enough to hold attention without one?
3. If no to both — add a forward hook or emphasis line.

**Red flags:**
- 2+ minutes without a hook during setup
- Section transitions with no tension
- Exposition dumps without forward momentum
- Ending a section on flat information instead of a punch

## Quick Checklist

Before finalizing a script:

- [ ] Does the cold open hook morbid curiosity immediately?
- [ ] Is there a hook every 60-90 seconds?
- [ ] Is there a forward hook if setup exceeds 90 seconds?
- [ ] Are characters named and given relationships?
- [ ] Is the villain clear?
- [ ] Does the horror deliver on what the thumbnail promised?
- [ ] Is the ending emotionally satisfying?
- [ ] Would a history buff find this accurate?
- [ ] Is there a "holy shit" moment they'll remember?
- [ ] Does every section end on a punch, not flat information?
