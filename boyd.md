9000 miles from Britain, on the far side of the earth, dozens of sailors would be brutally murdered and cannibalised.

The story of the Boyd Massacre continues to terrify to this day.

This is a tale of lost hope, at the ends of the earth.

Boyd

Our story begins in Britain, in 1783, with a ship.

Boyd was a British brigantine, a type of vessel used  to transport cargo across oceans.

In 1795 she was commissioned to take the dangerous Cape of Good Hope voyage, making stops in Bengal and Calcutta in India.

By early 1800 she had been repurposed as a convict ship, chartered to take the perilous voyage to the newly colonised land of Australia.

She was captained by John Thompson, an experienced commander.

On March 10, 1809 139 male convicts were loaded onto the ship setting sail for the southern continent.

Arriving in Australia in October, Boyd offloaded the prisoners at the new colony of Port Jackson, and set sail again.

She was bound for New Zealand, on a mission to source good timber as cargo.

Fateful voyage

Sailing to the distant islands, Boyd carried a crew and passengers totalling 70 souls.

Among the passengers were several freed convicts, hoping to make a new life in New Zealand.

But the ship’s crew also included a special passenger, unlike the ranks of british seaman

A boy from New Zealand called Te Ara, 

Te Ara was the son of an important Maori chieftain, from whangaroa bay on the North Island.

For the last year Te Ara had been sailing the southern ocean on whaling vessels, earning his keep by working as a ship’s boy.
He had been taken on as crew in Port Jackson, picked by the captain for his knowledge of New Zealand and its people.

But onboard, something would happen that would set in motion events that would doom the crew of the Boyd.

Halfway through the voyage across the stormy Tasman Sea, Te Ara caught the ire of the ship’s master.

One version of events recounts how the ship’s cook accidentally threw some cutlery overboard.

Seeking to shift the blame, the cook accused Te Ara of theft.

Another version of events claims that Te Ara was lazy and sullen, being the son of a chieftain he refused to perform his duties as ship’s boy.

Whatever the turn of events, the captain proved himself a cruel master.

He brought Te Ara to the ship’s anchor, and tied him down.

For days Te Ara was deprived of food and water as punishment.

But this wasn’t enough for the captain, and as Te Ara refused to cooperate, the captain’s anger grew.

Taking out the ship’s cat o nine tails, the Thompson had the boy whipped mercilessly.

This humiliation caused Te Ara’s heart to burn with rage.

The boy in that moment decided to exact revenge on the cruel captain, and the ship itself.

As Te Ara was recovering the whipping, he hatched a plan.

He decided to convince the Thompson that he had learned his lesson, that he would perform his duties without complaint, in an attempt to regain his trust

As time passed, the captain thought that the boy had learned his lesson and had fallen into line.

After working hard to regain the Thompson’s trust, Te Ara convinced him to sail to Whangaroa Bay on the North Island of New Zealand.

Te Ara spoke of vast forests of tall trees, perfect timber suitable to fulfil the ship’s mission.

This was a lie, to convince the captain to bring Te Ara back to his tribe.


Contact

After several weeks of sailing, the Boyd sighted New Zealand.

Changing course to a northerly direction, Te Ara helped guide the captain to Whangaroa Bay.

As the ship drew nearer to the coast it dropped anchor.

It was at this moment that Te Ara seized his chance.

Jumping overboard, Te Ara swam to shore, leaving the ship in his wake.

Te Ara made his way through the forest to the village of his tribe.

Speaking with tribal elders, he told the story of his brutal treatment. 

The boy was the son of a chieftan, and even though british law permitted Captain Thompson to flog any man under his command, the Maori did not see it the same way.

To attack the chieftan’s son was to attack the chieftan himself

This would demand retribution.

The tribe formed a plan to avenge this indignity.

Making contact with the Europeans, the tribe’s chieftain, named Te Puhi, invited Captain Thompson on an expedition, up a local river

With him, the commander took his chief officer and three other men.

Packed into Maori canoes, the scouting party made its way up the river, eventually losing sight of the ship.

It was at this point that John Thompson, the cruel captain, would meet his retribution.

Massacre

After travelling a while upriver, the Maori lead the scouting party to shore, dragging their canoes onto the sandy beach.

It was at this point that a signal was given, and the party were set upon by dozens of Maori warriors, who brutally clubbed the europeans to death.

Their bodies were carried back to the village where they were dismembered and consumed by the villagers.

But for the maori chieftain, this act wasn’t enough, the entire crew of the Boyd would have to be destroyed to satisfy the injustice.

Stripping the bodies bare, the warriors donned the clothes of the slain englishmen.

Dressed in their clothes, the Maori’s patiently waited

Darkness fell and opportunity arrived

Gathering themselves into a longboat, the maori began to row for the Boyd.

Onboard the ship, the crew were not expecting the Captain to return so soon, but were nonetheless unaware of what was about to take place.

Amidst the darkness the crew would not have been able to see that the men in the boat were not the men who had left on the scouting party.

Drawing alongside the ship, the maori hailed the crew of the Boyd.

But waiting in the darkness were other Maori canoes, filled with dozens of warriors.

The boats drew close to the Boyd, surrounding it in the darkness.

The signal was given.

Leaping aboard the ship, the warriors set upon the crew with a furious vengeance, striking and killing man after man on deck.

Several of the ships occupants managed to scale the ships rigging and hide amongst the canvas and ropes.

From there they watched with utter terror as a scene of carnage unfolded.

Belowdecks several of the freed convicts and the remaining crew huddled, attempting to hide from the onslaught.

Searching the ship, the maori dragged the cowering europeans onto the deck, where one by one they were clubbed to death.

The bodies of many of the crew were brutally dismembered and piled into heaps on the ship’s deck.

Survival

Of the 70 souls who set sail from Port Jackson colony, only five had survived the massacre.

Ann Morley a freed convict who had carried with her a newborn infant.

Thomas Davis, who had wedged himself deep into the hold of the ship, hiding amongst the ship’s cargo.

The ship’s second mate, and Elizabeth Broughton, a toddler.

The Maori warriors gathered the bloody corpses of the slain europeans into their canoes and paddled off into the night.

Waiting until dawn, the survivors left their hiding places and gathered together on the ship’s deck.

We can only imagine the utter terror that must have gripped the survivors of the massacre.

The survivors debated what to do next.

Should they abandon the ship and make their way by land to the nearest settlement?

Should they wait for rescue from a passing ship?

It was at this moment though that fate had other things in store for the survivors.

Canoes appeared on the horizon. 

Drawing alongside the ship, and climbing aboard were several Maori warriors.

But it wasn’t Te Puhi returning to finish his bloody task, but those from a different tribe.

A new chieftain named Tippahee climbed aboard.

The survivors did not speak the local language, but it was obvious to Tippahee what had taken place onboard the Boyd that night.

Tippahee decided to offer assistance to the ship’s survivors, and gathered them into his canoes.

He was to take them to his village to decide what to do next.

As the canoes made their way along the coast, their luck however took a turn for the worse.

War canoes were spotted rowing toward Tipahee and the rescued survivors.

The whangaroa tribe had returned.



With few options, Tipahee returned to the shore and decided to make his escape by foot.

Landing just behind them, the whangaroa lept from their canoes and chased the fleeing party.

In the chaos, the whangaroa managed to capture the fleeing europeans.

They were bound together and then loaded into canoes. 

Te Puhi transported his prisoners back to his village.

Little is known about the events following this, but it was revealed later that prisoners were treated with no kindness.

One of the survivors, the ship’s second mate, was put to death and eaten, after he could no longer make fishing hooks for the tribe.

Destruction

Without a crew the Boyd was left anchored in Whangaroa bay.

Several weeks passed.

Te Puhi decided to return to the ship.

He was after the ship’s gunpowder

At this point in history, New Zealand colonists were engaged in warfare with the local tribes, who had learned the importance of firearms in their struggle against the colonisers.

These new weapons would help the Whangaroa tribe.

Climbing aboard, Te Puhi found the ship’s armory, deep below the waterline.

There they found muskets and large barrels of gunpowder

The Maori attempted to work the new weapons, but unfamiliar with them, they turned to smashing open barrels of gunpowder

With the powder spilled all across the floor, one of the tribesman struck a flint in an attempt to fire a musket.

This spark started a fire, triggering an enormous explosion that killed the man along with nine others.

Above deck, Te Puhi and other members of the tribe saw flames leaping from below, and made the decision to jump off the burning ship.

Abandoning the ship, the maori gathered into their canoes and left the Boyd to burn.

Rescue

News of the massacre travelled fast to the surrounding colonial settlements.

Wild tales of brutal murders and vicious cannibalism electrified the colonists.

The stories also told of several survivors, in the captivity of a warchief, Te Puhi.

Hearing this news, a local Captain, Alexander Berry put together a rescue party and sailed for whangaroa bay.

His mission was to recover the european prisoners.

Sailing to different maori settlements, Captain Berry captured and held both Te Puhi (the murderous chieftain) and Tipahee (the chieftain who offered assistance), holding them both hostage.

He demanded the safe release of the survivors of HMS Boyd.

Berry told the chiefs that they were to be transported back to Europe to answer for their crimes unless they returned the stolen property from the ship and returned the prisoners.

Messengers were sent to their villages and it was agreed that the prisoners should go free.

Captain Berry also took possession of the ship’s journal and other articles of value.

The imprisoned leaders were released back to their villages, stripping them of their ranks of chieftan.

The blood debt had been paid, and to the Maori, the matter was now finally settled.

The Boyd’s debt had been paid.

The wreck of the Boyd by now was a burnt-out sunken hull. Māori declared the hull tapu, or forbidden to visit.

Aftermath

After all this fighting, one would think that the demands of retribution would be finished.
 
But this was not the case for many colonists who lived in new zealand.

They demanded that further punishment should be met on the maori, for such a horrific act.

In March 1810 the crews of five whaling ships decided to exact their vengeance on the local tribes.

Sailing to Wairora Bay, the crew made anchor and landed their longboats.

Making their way to a nearby village, the men fired upon the villagers, slaughtering dozens of men, women and children.

But the whalers had made a grave mistake, the village they had attacked belonged to Tippahee, the chieftain who had attempted to rescue the survivors of the Boyd.

Tippahee was not present when the reprisals took place.

After the killing was done, the whalers returned to their ships and sailed away, leaving a scene of destruction in their wake.

Learning the true cause for his village’s destruction, Tippahee took up arms and gathered together his surviving warriors. He made his way to whangaroa bay and attacked the tribe of Te Pehu.

Tippahee was killed in the fighting, along with many of his warriors.

We do not know if the murderous chieftan Te Puhi had justice served on him.

News of the Boyd massacre reached Australia and then travelled to Europe with returning ships. 

The brutal killings terrified those in Britain, and many ships bound for the distant islands cancelled their voyages, for fear of being slaughtered like those on the Boyd.

For many years after the events the Maori carried a fearsome reputation locals. 

A pamphlet circulating in Europe warned sailors off the ‘Cannibal Isles’ – ‘touch not that cursed shore lest you these Cannibals pursue’.

The brutal humiliation of the ship’s boy Te Ara at the hands of Captain Thompson came back to haunt the crew of the Boyd.

If the captain had only shown some restraint, this horrific massacre may never have come to pass.

Te Ara got his revenge.
