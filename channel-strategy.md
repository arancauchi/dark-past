# Channel Strategy: Comprehensive Analysis

Based on YouTube Analytics API data (Nov 2025) across 8 videos, 2.3M total views.

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The diagnosis:** You have a subscriber-retention problem disguised as a content problem.

Your channel is caught in a loop:
1. Subscribers watch and enjoy (39-48% retention)
2. Algorithm tests with cold audience
3. Cold audience bounces hard (24% retention)
4. Algorithm stops pushing
5. Video dies, channel stays stagnant

**The prescription:** Fix the first 90 seconds for strangers, not fans.

## THE NUMBERS THAT MATTER

### Channel Health Snapshot

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total views | 2.34M | Strong lifetime |
| Monthly views (Nov) | ~3,200 | Stagnant |
| Traffic: Subscriber | **68%** | Dangerously high |
| Traffic: Search | 10% | Too low |
| Traffic: Suggested | 8% | Too low |
| Demo: Male 55+ | 56% | Narrow but loyal |

### The Two Videos That Made Your Channel

| Video | Views | Daily Now | Traffic Mix | Status |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Boyd (Cannibals) | 1.6M | 38/day | 42% sub, 23% search, 18% related | **Evergreen** |
| Soviet Space | 641K | 1/day | 67% sub, 11% search, 7% related | **Dead** |

**Critical insight:** Boyd is alive because of SEARCH ("cannibals" keyword). Soviet is dead because it was algorithm-driven with no searchable hook. When the algorithm stopped pushing Soviet, it died. Boyd keeps finding new viewers organically.

---

## THE CORE PROBLEM: SUBSCRIBER DEPENDENCY

Your channel gets 68% of views from subscribers. This is a trap.

**What this means:**
- New videos only reach your existing ~5K subscribers
- Algorithm tests your content with cold traffic
- Cold traffic bounces in the first 60 seconds
- Algorithm concludes "this video doesn't work" and stops pushing
- You're stuck in a loop serving the same audience

**The data proving this (Kabul case study):**

| Day | Views | Retention | What Happened |
|-----|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Day 1 | 90 | **39%** | Subscribers watching |
| Day 3 | 1,156 | **24%** | Algorithm pushed to browse |
| Day 5 | 26 | **48%** | Organic viewers who searched |

Your subscribers retained at 39%. Strangers at 24%. But viewers who FOUND you organically retained at 48% — higher than anyone.

**Translation:** The content is good. The opening doesn't hook strangers. The algorithm tested and rejected.

---

## WHY BOYD WORKED (AND KEEPS WORKING)

Boyd is your only truly successful video. Here's why:

### 1. Searchable Keyword
"CANNIBALS" is a high-volume search term. People actively look for cannibal content. This gives the video eternal discoverability.

- Boyd: 23% from search
- Soviet: 11% from search
- Kabul: 0.8% from search

### 2. Traffic Diversity
Boyd has the healthiest traffic mix:
- 42% subscriber (lowest of all videos)
- 23% search
- 18% related/suggested

This means Boyd finds NEW viewers constantly. Other videos are 67-93% subscriber-dependent.

### 3. Revenge Narrative
Boyd isn't just horror — it's JUSTICE. The villain (Thompson) gets what he deserves. Viewers stay to see the revenge fulfilled.

### 4. Clear Villain by Minute 2
Thompson whips Te Ara on screen. We HATE him immediately. Every other video has weak or distant villains:
- Kabul: Elphinstone (incompetent, not cruel)
- Medusa: Chaumareys (distant, in lifeboats)
- Soviet: "The system" (abstract)

---

## WHY SOVIET HIT BUT DIED

Soviet got 641K views but now gets 1 view/day. Here's why:

### It Was Algorithm-Driven, Not Search-Driven
- No one searches "soviet space disasters"
- The algorithm pushed it to browse/suggested during a hot period
- When algorithm attention moved on, the video died
- No evergreen keyword to sustain it

### The Listicle Helped Retention, Not Discovery
The "3 disasters" format kept viewers watching (52% retention — excellent). But it didn't help new people FIND the video.

**Lesson:** Retention keeps the algorithm pushing. But search/keywords keep videos alive after the algorithm moves on.

---

## WHAT'S HINDERING GROWTH

### 1. Cold Opens Don't Convert Strangers

Your subscribers are primed. They know your style, trust you, will give you 30+ seconds. Strangers decide in 10 seconds.

**Kabul's open:**
```
Afghanistan has seen endless empires rise at its gates—yet within its
mountains, their legacies lie in ruin and dust.
```
This is beautiful writing. It's also a stranger-killer. No hook, no visceral detail, no reason to stay.

**Boyd's open** (even though weak) worked because the TITLE ("CANNIBALS") pre-sold the video. Kabul's title makes no such promise.

### 2. Best Content Is Buried

| Video | Climax Location | Viewers Who See It |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Kabul | Minute 10-13 (Gandamak) | 28% |
| Boyd | Minute 6-8 (massacre) | ~40% |
| Soviet | Minute 3-4 (Komarov call) | ~50% |

Soviet front-loaded its best moment (Komarov's dying accusation). Kabul buried it. The 28% who stayed past minute 2 watched to minute 13 — the content is good, the funnel is broken.

### 3. No Search Strategy

Only Boyd has a searchable keyword. Other videos rely entirely on:
- Subscriber notifications
- Algorithm browse/suggested

When neither fires, the video dies.

### 4. Videos Are Too Long for Cold Traffic

| Length | Retention | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| 6 min | 65.8% | WW1 Tank |
| 10 min | 52.1% | Soviet |
| 14 min | 27-30% | Kabul, Shipwreck |

Shorter videos retain 2x better. But you need watch time for the algorithm. **Sweet spot: 9-11 minutes.**

---

## WHAT'S WORKING

### 1. Subscriber Loyalty
Your existing audience is engaged:
- 39-48% retention among subscribers
- 10% like rate on best videos
- Comments/engagement strong

### 2. Content Quality
The problem is funneling, not content. Viewers who stay past minute 2 watch to the end. The storytelling works.

### 3. UK/Commonwealth Audience
UK viewers watch longest (4.7 min avg). British military/maritime history resonates. This is your strongest geographic niche.

### 4. Older Male Demo
56% of viewers are 55+. They're patient, loyal, and engaged. Don't abandon them — but recognize algorithm tests with younger viewers who bounce faster.

---

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Tier 1: Fix Immediately

**1. Rewrite Cold Opens for Strangers**

Every video needs a "stranger-proof" open. First 30 seconds must:
- Deliver a visceral detail (blood, death, specific horror)
- Name a person (not "the army" — a PERSON)
- Create immediate curiosity gap
- Tell strangers what they're getting

**Test:** Would someone who's never heard of you stay past 10 seconds?

**2. Front-Load Best Content**

Use frame structure:
```
[Climax/Horror] → [How we got here] → [Return to climax with context]
```

Open with the Gandamak last stand, THEN tell the story of how they got there.

**3. Target Searchable Keywords**

For every video, ask: "What would someone type into YouTube to find this?"

- "Cannibals" ✓
- "Soviet space" ✗ (too vague)
- "British army Afghanistan" ✗ (no horror word)

Better: "Worst Military Disaster" / "Army Frozen to Death" / "Massacre"

### Tier 2: Strategic Changes

**4. Shorten to 9-11 Minutes**

Your 14-minute videos get 27% retention. Your 10-minute videos get 52%. The math is clear.

This is painful — you have more story to tell. But strangers don't care. Get them hooked first.

**5. Build Related Video Traffic**

Related/suggested viewers watch longest (4.9 min/view). Optimize for this:
- End screens linking to related videos
- Consistent visual style (thumbnails signal "this is like that")
- Series/playlist structure

**6. Reduce Subscriber Dependency**

Target: Get subscriber traffic below 50% (currently 68%)

How:
- Searchable titles and keywords
- Broader topic selection (not just British military history)
- Thumbnail/title packages that work for strangers

### Tier 3: Experiments

**7. Try a 6-8 Minute Video**

Your WW1 Tank video (6 min) got 65.8% retention and 10% like rate. Test whether shorter videos can break through to algorithm.

**8. Listicle Format**

Soviet's "3 disasters" format helped retention. Consider:
- "3 Worst Expeditions That Ended in Cannibalism"
- "5 Ships That Became Floating Coffins"

Built-in "what's next?" curiosity.

**9. The Dying Accusation**

Soviet's emotional peak was Komarov blaming his killers with his dying breath, while his wife listened. This is the most powerful narrative device you've used. Look for stories with this element.

---

## TOPIC SELECTION FRAMEWORK

Score potential topics on:

| Criteria | Weight | Questions |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Searchable keyword | HIGH | Would people search for this? |
| Clear villain | HIGH | Can we hate someone by minute 2? |
| Specific victim | HIGH | Do we follow ONE person? |
| Visual horror | MED | Is the death visceral, not abstract? |
| Revenge/justice | MED | Does the villain face consequences? |
| Cover-up angle | LOW | Is there a "hidden truth" element? |

**Best topics have:**
- A searchable horror word (massacre, cannibals, disaster)
- A hateable villain who does something cruel ON SCREEN
- A named victim we follow through the story
- Climax happens early enough for 50%+ to see it

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### 30-Day Goals
- [x] New video retention: >35% (vs 27% Kabul) — **ACHIEVED: Medusa 35.4%**
- [ ] New video retention: >40% (next target)
- [ ] Subscriber traffic: <60% (vs 68% now)
- [ ] Search traffic: >15% (vs 10% now)

### 90-Day Goals
- [ ] One video with >50% retention
- [ ] One video with <50% subscriber traffic
- [ ] Monthly views: >5,000 (vs ~3,200 now)

### Signs It's Working
- Algorithm pushes to browse and retention holds (>30%)
- Search traffic grows as % of total
- New videos get related/suggested traffic from old videos

### Signs It's Not Working
- Retention tanks when algorithm tests (below 25%)
- 70%+ traffic still from subscribers
- Videos die after initial subscriber spike

---

## BOTTOM LINE

Your channel has proven it can make viral content (Boyd, Soviet). But you're stuck in a subscriber loop that prevents breakout.

**The fix is surgical, not wholesale:**
1. First 90 seconds must hook strangers (not fans)
2. Best content goes at minute 2-3, not minute 10
3. Every title needs a searchable horror keyword
4. Target 9-11 minutes, not 14+

The content is good. The funnel is broken. Fix the funnel.

# PART 2: VIDEO-BY-VIDEO LEARNINGS

Qualitative analysis of what worked and what didn't for each video.

---

## BOYD MASSACRE (1.6M views)

### What Worked

**1. Title did heavy lifting**
- "Eaten By CANNIBALS | The Boyd Massacre"
- "CANNIBALS" is a high-search, high-click word
- "Massacre" promises violence
- Clear, searchable, delivers what it promises

**2. Clear villain + victim dynamic**
- Captain Thompson is HATEABLE by minute 2
- Te Ara is sympathetic — a boy whipped for something he didn't do
- The whipping scene is visceral and specific
- Viewer wants Thompson to suffer

**3. Revenge narrative (not tragedy)**
- This isn't just "people died" — it's "justice was served"
- The massacre has dark satisfaction mixed with horror
- "Te Ara got his revenge" — satisfying conclusion
- Revenge narratives are inherently more engaging than pure tragedy

**4. Delivered the promised horror**
- Massacre scene is brutal and specific
- "brutally clubbed to death"
- "dismembered and consumed"
- Didn't sanitize it

### What Was Weak (But Didn't Kill It)

**1. Cold open was generic**
```
9000 miles from Britain, on the far side of the earth, dozens of sailors
would be brutally murdered and cannibalised.
```
- Tells, doesn't show
- No specific person or detail
- Should have lost viewers early — but title/topic carried it

**2. Long setup (ship history)**
- Lines 25-40 are dry exposition
- No hooks during this section
- Saved by the Te Ara whipping scene coming soon after

### Key Lesson

**Topic selection + villain/victim clarity can compensate for weak technical execution.**

Boyd proves that a revenge story with a hateable villain will hold attention even with script weaknesses.

---

## SOVIET SPACE DISASTERS (641K views, 52% retention)

### What Worked

**1. Cold open is direct and stat-based**
```
Plagued by corruption and desperate to beat the Americans at every turn,
the Soviet Space Program risked the lives of their cosmonauts at an
astonishing rate.

Until 1967, every death in space was that of a Russian cosmonaut.
```
- Not visceral like Greely, but CLEAR
- "Every death in space was Russian" — powerful stat, creates curiosity
- Establishes villain (Soviet system) immediately

**2. Listicle format has built-in retention**
- "3 worst disasters" = viewers know more is coming
- Each story is a fresh start
- "What's #1?" curiosity carries through
- Natural chapter breaks prevent fatigue

**3. Clear systemic villain throughout**
- "Soviet leadership became impatient"
- "rushed testing phase"
- "known design flaws"
- EVERY death blamed on the system = consistent villain

**4. Named victims with VISCERAL deaths**

Komarov:
- "At first, it was hard to distinguish what were his head, arms and legs"
- Crashed at 130 feet per second

Bondarenko:
- "The whole man was burned... completely devoid of skin"
- "Please do something to take the pain away"
- Suffered for 16 hours before dying

Soyuz 11 crew:
- "faces were a dark shade of blue, blood streamed from their ears and noses"
- 20 seconds to find the valve before death

**5. THE DYING ACCUSATION (emotional peak)**
```
As he plunged toward his death, Komarov was heard over the radio crying in rage.
He cursed the people who had put him inside the flawed spaceship.
He told mission control that he knew he was about to die and that the men
on the ground had killed him.
Komarov's wife was also on the call and asked what to say to their children.
```

This is INCREDIBLE:
- Victim explicitly blames the villain with dying breath
- Wife on the call = personal stakes
- Clear assignment of blame: "the men on the ground had killed him"

**6. Cover-up angle adds intrigue**
- "Soviet officials attempted to suppress... details"
- "Bonderanko was erased from public records"
- Creates "secret history" appeal

### Key Lessons

1. **Listicle format helps retention** — built-in "what's next?" curiosity
2. **Systemic villains work if consistent** — blame must be explicit throughout
3. **The dying accusation is powerful** — victim blaming villain with last breath
4. **Cover-ups make villains worse** — "they hid the truth" = more evil

---

## KABUL / BRITISH ARMY (1.8K views, 27% retention)

### What Went Wrong

**1. Cold open is abstract/poetic**
```
Afghanistan has seen endless empires rise at its gates—yet within its
mountains, their legacies lie in ruin and dust.
```
- Beautiful writing, terrible hook
- No specific person, no visceral detail
- "Legacies in ruin and dust" is vague doom

**2. Best content buried at minute 10-13**
- Gandamak last stand is INCREDIBLE
- "Not bloody likely!" — memorable
- "I am the army" — iconic line
- Only 28% of viewers ever see this

**3. Too much geopolitical setup (0:30-4:00)**
- British-Russian rivalry
- Dost Mohammad
- Army of Indus formed
- Bolan Pass march
- Morbid curiosity viewers leave during this

**4. Chronological structure**
- March → Kabul → Occupation → Uprising → Retreat → Death
- Most compelling content is at the END
- Should use frame structure: open with death, then explain how

**5. No villain, no victim**
- Elphinstone is incompetent but we don't hate him
- "16,000 people" is a number, not a person
- No one to root for

### What To Fix (If Re-editing)

**New cold open — Gandamak:**
```
On the morning of January 13th, 1842, seventy British soldiers formed
a circle on a frozen hillside.

They were surrounded by thousands of Afghan warriors.

Their fingers were black with frostbite. Their ammunition was gone.

A voice called from the heights, demanding surrender.

One sergeant shouted back: "Not bloody likely!"

They fixed bayonets.

What followed was a massacre. The snow turned red with blood.

One week earlier, sixteen thousand people had fled Kabul under a promise
of safe passage.

By the end, only one man would reach safety.
```

### Key Lesson

**Don't bury your best content. Open with the most compelling moment, then explain how it happened.**

The 28% who stayed past minute 2 watched to minute 13. The CONTENT is good. The FUNNEL is broken.

---

## MEDUSA / RAFT (77 views, 35% retention)

### Performance Data

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Views | 77 | Early days |
| Retention | **35%** | Above Kabul (27%), below target (40%+) |
| AVD | 3:32 | On 9:56 video |
| Like rate | 18% | Strong engagement from those who stay |

### Retention Curve Analysis

The retention curve reveals the **same pattern as Kabul**:

| Timestamp | What happens | Retention |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 0:00-0:30 | Cold open ("They killed them for the wine") | **Holds well** |
| 0:30-1:00 | Historical setup (Captain Chaumareys, convoy to Senegal) | **Sharp drop** |
| 1:00+ | Story continues | Gradual decline |

**The problem:** Cold open hooks viewers, then we immediately pivot to historical context and lose them. This is identical to Kabul's pattern — setup kills morbid curiosity viewers.

### What's Working

1. **Cold open is strong**: "They killed them for the wine" — visceral, specific, curiosity gap
2. **Hook density is good throughout**: Once past the setup, hooks land regularly
3. **"The woman" detail is powerful**: Humanizes the abstract death toll
4. **18% like rate**: Those who stay are highly engaged

### What's Not Working

1. **Setup transition (0:30-1:00)**: After the hook, we pivot to "In 1816, France's new king needed a captain..." — morbid curiosity viewers leave
2. **No clear villain early**: Chaumareys doesn't do anything cruel until later
3. **No single victim**: "150 people" is a number, not a person
4. **Villain is distant**: He's in the lifeboats, not on the raft

### Key Lesson: "One More Visceral Beat"

The cold open gives viewers ONE hook before pivoting to setup. That's not enough for strangers.

**The fix:** Give 2-3 visceral beats before ANY historical context. Stack hooks at the front.

**Current structure:**
```
[Hook: "They killed them for the wine"] → [Setup: "In 1816..."]
```

**Better structure:**
```
[Hook 1: "They killed them for the wine"]
[Hook 2: Second visceral detail — the vote, the bodies, the knife marks]
[Hook 3: Forward tease — "But the raft was just the beginning"]
→ [Setup: "In 1816..."]
```

Morbid curiosity viewers need to be FED before they'll tolerate any context. One hook isn't enough. Stack them.

### Comparison to Kabul

| Element | Kabul | Medusa |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Cold open | Abstract/poetic | Strong hook |
| 0:30-1:00 | Geopolitical setup | Historical setup |
| Result | 27% retention | 35% retention |
| Pattern | **Identical drop at setup** | **Identical drop at setup** |

Medusa's stronger cold open bought 8 percentage points of retention. But the setup transition still kills momentum. The lesson is consistent: **delay historical context until viewers are hooked.**

---

# PART 3: SCRIPTWRITING PRINCIPLES

Distilled from video analysis and data.

---

## Cold Opens

**Do:**
- Open with a specific person
- Use a visceral detail (knife marks, whipping, blood in snow)
- Create a curiosity gap
- Show, don't tell
- **Stack 2-3 hooks before ANY historical context** (see below)

**Don't:**
- Open with abstract/poetic language
- Open with geography or dates
- Open with "this is the story of..."
- Tell the viewer what to feel
- **Pivot to setup after just one hook** (proven failure pattern)

### The "One More Visceral Beat" Principle

**Data-proven pattern:** Both Kabul and Medusa show identical retention drops at 0:30-1:00 — exactly when historical setup begins. One hook isn't enough to earn the right to provide context.

**The problem:**
```
[Hook] → [Setup: "In 1816..."] → viewers leave
```

**The fix:**
```
[Hook 1: visceral detail]
[Hook 2: second horror beat]
[Hook 3: forward tease]
→ [Setup] → viewers tolerate context because they're invested
```

Morbid curiosity viewers need to be FED before they'll tolerate any context. Medusa's strong cold open bought 8 percentage points over Kabul (35% vs 27%), but both lost viewers at the same moment: **the pivot to historical setup.**

Stack hooks. Delay context. Earn the right to explain.

**Ranked cold opens:**
1. Greely — "When they exhumed the body... what they found was something far worse"
2. Medusa — "They killed them for the wine"
3. Soviet — "Every death in space was Russian"
4. Boyd — Generic but topic carried it
5. Kabul — Abstract, poetic, weak

---

## Villain/Victim Dynamics

**Strong villain characteristics:**
- We SEE them do something cruel (Thompson whips Te Ara)
- Their cruelty is specific and personal
- There's a victim we sympathize with
- The villain faces consequences (or doesn't — which creates outrage)

**Weak villain characteristics:**
- Incompetent but not cruel (Elphinstone)
- Distant from the action (Chaumareys)
- Ambiguous blame (the faction in Greely)
- No specific victim

**Villain strength by video:**
| Video | Villain | Strength |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Boyd | Thompson | STRONG (whipping scene) |
| Soviet | Soviet system | MODERATE (consistent blame) |
| Medusa | Chaumareys | WEAK (distant) |
| Kabul | Elphinstone | WEAK (incompetent, not cruel) |

---

## Narrative Structure

**Chronological (weak for retention):**
- Events in order
- Best content often at the end
- Setup loses viewers before payoff
- Example: Kabul

**Frame structure (strong for retention):**
- Open with the horror/climax
- Pull back to tell the story
- Return to the opening moment with full context
- Example: Greely

**Revenge structure (strongest engagement):**
- Wrong committed against victim
- Plan for revenge
- Revenge executed
- Example: Boyd

**Listicle (strong for retention):**
- Built-in "what's #1?" curiosity
- Fresh starts prevent fatigue
- Example: Soviet

---

## Hook Density

**Target: One hook every 60-90 seconds**

**Forward hooks** (tease what's coming):
- "In three months, all but one would be dead"
- "By the end, the knife marks would tell a different story"
- "But not everyone died of starvation"

**Emphasis hooks** (underline what just happened):
- "They killed them for the wine"
- "A single gunshot echoed across the ice"
- "He never returned"

**Weakest sections to watch:**
- Setup/context (0:30-2:00 typically)
- Transitions between acts
- Geography/dates/names

---

## Title Strategy

### The Title + Thumbnail Equation

Titles and thumbnails work as a **package**. One can be soft if the other is hard.

| Combo | Works? | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Hard title + Soft thumbnail | ✓ | Boyd: "CANNIBALS" title carries soft thumbnail |
| Soft title + Hard thumbnail | ✓ | Thoughty2: vague title, screaming bloody face thumbnail |
| Hard title + Hard thumbnail | ✓ | Maximum impact, may feel clickbaity |
| Soft title + Soft thumbnail | ✗ | Nothing sells the horror — viewers scroll past |

**If your thumbnail is subtle, your title must do the work.**

### Big Channels vs Small Channels

Big channels (100K+ subs) can afford curiosity-gap titles:
- "These Men Were Doomed When They Stepped on This Raft" (Thoughty2, 542K views)
- "Left STRANDED On Wooden Raft In the Ocean" (Scary Interesting, 923K views)

**Why this works for them:**
- Subscribers click based on brand trust
- Algorithm already knows their audience
- Thumbnail does the horror work

**Why this doesn't work for you (yet):**
- 68% subscriber dependency = need NEW viewers
- Need search traffic to escape the loop
- Algorithm doesn't know your audience yet

**Small channels need searchable keywords.** Boyd proves it: "CANNIBALS" drives 23% search traffic.

### The Boyd Formula

Boyd's title structure is proven:
```
[Visceral Hook] + [Searchable Context]
"Eaten By CANNIBALS | The Boyd Massacre"
```

- First half: emotional/visceral hook
- Pipe separator: clean break
- Second half: searchable term + genre signal

**Apply to other videos:**
```
"Shipwreck Survivors Turned Cannibal | Raft of the Medusa"
"Stranded in the Arctic, They Ate Each Other | The Greely Expedition"
```

### High-Performing Words

Proven search terms for this niche:
- CANNIBALS / CANNIBALISM (Boyd = 23% search traffic)
- MASSACRE
- SURVIVED / SURVIVAL
- ABANDONED / STRANDED
- SHIPWRECK
- Numbers (150 People, Only 15 Survived)

### Weak Approaches

- **Pure curiosity gap**: "Then Came the Vote" — intriguing but not searchable
- **Generic**: "The Dark Story of X" — no hook
- **Too long**: >60 chars gets truncated in search results
- **Soft title + soft thumbnail**: nothing sells the click

### Title Checklist

Before publishing, verify:
- [ ] Contains at least one searchable horror word?
- [ ] Clear genre signal (shipwreck, expedition, disaster)?
- [ ] Under 60 characters (or key info front-loaded)?
- [ ] Works with thumbnail as a package?
- [ ] Would a stranger understand what they're getting?

## Video Scorecard

Use before recording:

| Element | Score (1-5) | Questions |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Cold open hook | | Specific? Visceral? Curiosity gap? |
| Hook stacking | | 2-3 hooks BEFORE any historical context? |
| Villain clarity | | Do we hate someone by minute 2? |
| Victim sympathy | | Do we care about someone specific? |
| Hook density | | Hook every 60-90 seconds throughout? |
| Best content placement | | Is the climax in the first half? |
