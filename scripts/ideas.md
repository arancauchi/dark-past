Military disasters and lesser-known tragedies for future scripts.

---

## Tier 1 — Strong Fits

### Wilhelm Gustloff (1945)
- **Deaths:** 9,000+
- **Hook:** Deadliest maritime disaster ever. Soviet submarine torpedoed a German refugee ship in the Baltic.
- **Why it works:** Titanic killed 1,500. This killed 9,000 — and nobody knows it. Women and children freezing in the Baltic. Refugees, not soldiers. Clear villain (Soviet sub captain). Searchable: "deadliest shipwreck", "worst maritime disaster"
- **Potential challenges:** German victims in WW2 is sensitive territory. Needs careful framing.

### Siege of Kut (1915-16)
- **Deaths:** 13,000
- **Hook:** British army besieged in Mesopotamia. Surrendered. 70% died on death march or in captivity.
- **Why it works:** British military disaster like Kabul. Starvation, Ottoman abuse, officers treated better than enlisted (class angle). Government cover-up. Your core audience.
- **Potential challenges:** Less visually dramatic than a single event. May need tight focus on the death march.

### Battle of Isandlwana (1879)
- **Deaths:** 1,300
- **Hook:** British army massacred by Zulus in a single afternoon. Disemboweled on the field.
- **Why it works:** Clear villain (arrogant British commanders ignored warnings). Visceral combat. Leads into Rorke's Drift if you want a two-parter or sequel hook.
- **Potential challenges:** Colonial framing needs care. Zulus as "villains" won't work — British hubris is the villain.

## Tier 2 — Interesting Angles

### Slapton Sands (1944)
- **Deaths:** 749
- **Hook:** D-Day rehearsal gone wrong. German E-boats attacked American troops practicing on a British beach. Covered up for decades.
- **Why it works:** American soldiers, friendly fire chaos, government secrecy. Shorter video potential (6-7 min). Searchable: "D-Day disaster", "Exercise Tiger"
- **Potential challenges:** Less visceral than others. More "tragic accident" than massacre.

### HMS Birkenhead (1852)
- **Deaths:** 445
- **Hook:** Troopship sank off South Africa. Soldiers stood at attention and drowned while women and children took the lifeboats.
- **Why it works:** Origin of "women and children first." Eblé-style heroic sacrifice. Sharks in the water. Strong emotional anchor.
- **Potential challenges:** No clear villain — more tragedy than atrocity.

### Battle of Annual (1921)
- **Deaths:** 8,000+
- **Hook:** Spanish army massacred by Riffian forces in Morocco. Collapsed in days. Triggered political crisis and eventual coup.
- **Why it works:** Very obscure in English-speaking world. Colonial hubris punished. Mass panic and rout.
- **Potential challenges:** Less familiar context for your audience. May need more setup.

## Tier 1 — Non-Military

### SS Sultana (1865)
- **Deaths:** 1,800
- **Hook:** Steamboat exploded on the Mississippi carrying Union POWs finally going home. More dead than Titanic.
- **Why it works:** "More dead than Titanic, and you've never heard of it." Lincoln was assassinated the same week — the story was buried. POWs survived Confederate prison camps only to die on the way home. Cruel irony. Searchable: "deadliest maritime disaster America", "worse than Titanic"
- **Potential challenges:** Explosion is the climax — need strong character focus.

### Victoria Hall Stampede (1883)
- **Deaths:** 183 children
- **Hook:** Kids rushed down stairs for prizes at a magic show. The door at the bottom only opened inward. 183 children crushed to death.
- **Why it works:** Children. Magic show. A door that opened the wrong way. Simple, horrifying, obscure. Led to fire safety laws requiring outward-opening doors.
- **Potential challenges:** Extremely dark — dead children throughout. Handle with care.

### The Iolaire (1919)
- **Deaths:** 201
- **Hook:** Scottish soldiers survived the entire First World War. Their ship sank within sight of home on New Year's Day. Bodies washed up on their own beaches.
- **Why it works:** Cruel irony is the entire story. Families watched from shore. Some soldiers swam to rocks and froze to death. One man saved 40 people with a rope. Obscure outside Scotland.
- **Potential challenges:** Smaller death toll. Emotional weight has to carry it.

## Tier 2 — Non-Military

### Peshtigo Fire (1871)
- **Deaths:** 1,500-2,500
- **Hook:** Deadliest fire in American history. Firestorm so hot the air itself ignited. People burst into flames. Rivers boiled.
- **Why it works:** "The fire that was erased from history." Chicago Fire happened the same day — Peshtigo was forgotten. Entire towns vanished. Searchable: "deadliest fire America", "forgotten fire"
- **Potential challenges:** No clear villain — nature/accident.

### Children's Blizzard (1888)
- **Deaths:** 235
- **Hook:** Warm January morning. Kids walked to school in shirtsleeves. Blizzard hit in minutes. Temperature dropped 40 degrees. Schoolchildren froze on the prairie within sight of home.
- **Why it works:** Children. Cruel weather. Teachers who made life-or-death decisions — some saved their students, some killed them. Individual stories.
- **Potential challenges:** Dispersed across the prairie — no single location.

### SS General Slocum (1904)
- **Deaths:** 1,021
- **Hook:** NYC excursion boat caught fire in the East River. Mostly women and children from a German-American church picnic. Wiped out an entire community.
- **Why it works:** Deadliest NYC disaster until 9/11. Lifeboats were painted shut. Life vests were filled with cork dust that dragged people under. Corporate negligence. Community never recovered — they abandoned their neighborhood.
- **Potential challenges:** Less known outside US.

### Courrières Mine Disaster (1906)
- **Deaths:** 1,099
- **Hook:** Worst mining disaster in European history. Explosion trapped thousands underground. But 13 survivors emerged after 20 days in the dark.
- **Why it works:** "What did they do down there for 20 days?" Survival horror. One group found by rescuers, another group clawed their way out. Company tried to restart mining while bodies were still underground — riots followed.
- **Potential challenges:** French context less familiar to your audience.

### Byford Dolphin Accident (1983)
- **Deaths:** 5
- **Hook:** Diving bell decompressed in a fraction of a second. One man was forced through a 24-inch opening. His organs were found 30 feet away.
- **Why it works:** Most visceral industrial accident ever recorded. Medical examiners documented everything. The physics of what happened to the human body is horrifying.
- **Potential challenges:** Only 5 dead. Very short — maybe 5-6 minute video max.

### The Radium Girls (1917-26)
- **Deaths:** ~50+ (slow deaths over years)
- **Hook:** Women painted watch dials with radium. Company told them it was safe. They licked their brushes to get a fine point. Their jaws rotted off.
- **Why it works:** Clear corporate villain. Cover-up for years. Women who fought back and won. "Their bones glowed in the dark at their autopsies."
- **Potential challenges:** Slow deaths over years — harder to structure. More documentary than disaster.

## Rejected / Parked

(Topics considered but not pursued)

- **Sicilian Expedition (415 BC)** — Ancient history harder to make visceral
- **Cap Arcona (1945)** — Allies bombing concentration camp prisoners. Important but extremely dark/complex.
- **Charge of the Light Brigade** — Too well known
