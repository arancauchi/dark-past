COLD OPEN

In 1884, six emaciated men staggered out of the Arctic. 

The food had run out years ago.

But how do you survive three years when there's nothing left to eat?

  ACT 1: THE MISSION
In 1881, an American expedition left for the Arctic, determined to reach farther north than any team in history. They landed at Lady Franklin Bay on the northeastern coast of Ellesmere Island and built a small wooden station they named Fort Conger.
Left alone in the Arctic, they were told the ship would return in a year with fresh supplies.
Leading the party was Lieutenant Adolphus Greely — a Civil War veteran who’d enlisted at seventeen, taken a bullet to the face at the Battle of Antietam, and kept fighting. His second-in-command was Lieutenant Frederick Kislingbury, Greely’s closest friend. Kislingbury had just lost his wife; he joined the expedition to outrun the grief.


But within days, the grief caught up with Frederick. He struggled to function. Some mornings he couldn't get up at all.

Greely was embarrassed. He discharged his closest friend and ordered him to leave on the departing supply ship.
Kislingbury raced to catch it — but he reached the shoreline only to watch it vanish between the icebergs.
He was trapped. Cast out, but unable to leave. A ghost in Greely’s expedition.

ACT 2: ABANDONED
Almost immediately, the outside world began to slip away.
In 1882 the first resupply ship never reached them. 
Ice blocked the route so the captain left a cache at Cape Sabine, 240 miles to the south, before turning back.
In 1883, a second ship tried to reach them. 

The captain pushed too far into the ice. The floes closed around the hull like a fist.

Wood splintered. Water rushed in. The ship was crushed and swallowed by the Arctic Ocean.

All the supplies sank with it.

The expedition were about to face a third winter alone.

Back at Fort Conger, nothing reached Greeley or his men. No ship. No rescue. No word. Two brutal years dragged by in the unending cold.

Frederick proved himself useful — hunting, bringing back seals. The men respected him for it.

Greely never did.

By August 1883, the animals had migrated south and the hunters were returning empty-handed. The food quickly ran out.

ACT 3: CONTINGENCY PLAN

A stark choice confronted them: stay and meet certain death, or gamble on a 240-mile trek to Cape Sabine, where a cache of supplies was supposed to be waiting should the supply ship fail to reach them.

On August 9th, the party of 25 mustered all their energy and set out to the south.

The journey nearly killed them.

They dragged boats across shifting ice for weeks. When the floes trapped them, they drifted until currents finally pushed them close enough to reach shore.

Seven weeks of dragging boats across ice. When they finally reached Cape Sabine, the men wept with relief.

Then they saw what was waiting. A few crates. Not nearly enough.


ACT 4: THE SLOW DEATH
Greely divided the rations himself. Each day, portions grew smaller. Men's faces grew hollow.

By January 1884, they were eating dog biscuits. Then boiled leather straps. Then lichens scraped from rocks.

On January 18th, Sergeant William Cross collapsed and died - the first to succumb to scurvy and starvation.

George Rice and Joseph Ellison were well liked among the party for their optimism and courage against all odds — the two men volunteered to trek south for more supplies. In those conditions, it was close to a death sentence.
But against all expectation, they found something: an old British supply depot from the Nares expedition. Inside were four crates of preserved meat, soup tins, and a few hard biscuits — leftovers abandoned years earlier at Cape Sabine.
It wasn’t much. But for a starving party, it meant a little more time.
But on the return journey, disaster struck. Ellison’s legs froze so badly he could no longer walk, and the men were forced to abandon the precious meat just to carry him back alive.
Rice refused to let that sacrifice be for nothing. After helping bring Ellison to safety, he turned around and went back into the storm to retrieve the crates.
He never returned. They found him days later, face down in the snow — and morale collapsed with him.


Kislingbury watched as Greely's inner circle—the men who slept closest to him in the shelter—still had strength to move. To fish. To survive.

His own hands were frostbitten. He could barely move.

Three years he'd waited for Greely to forgive him. It never came.

He began to unravel. The months of darkness, the hunger, the isolation—it broke something in him. He stopped responding to questions. When he spoke at all, it was only childlike muttering.

On June 1st, Kislingbury died. His stomach was empty. He had eaten nothing but indigestible seal skin for days.

His body was carried outside and left in the snow with the others.

That same week, others in the shelter were still catching shrimp.

But by the end of the month, half the expedition was dead.

The deepest fears of the men were about to come true, one member of the expedition wrote:

"I am much afraid of a demoralization [...] which may result in things too bad to contemplate."
The survivors had grown too weak to dig graves.
The corpses began to pile up.

But not everyone died of starvation.

ACT 4: THE EXECUTION

One man broke first.
Charles Henry couldn’t stop stealing. Caught again and again, he grew desperate as the starvation worsened.
Greely issued a decree: anyone stealing food would be executed.
The very next day, Charles was caught taking shrimp from the nets. Greely didn’t hesitate—he ordered two men to take him from the camp.
The others sat in silence, too weak to protest, too hungry to object.

A single gunshot echoed across the ice.

That night, two more men died of starvation.

Only seven survivors remained.

ACT 5: THE RESCUE

The surviving men lay in their shelter. They had eaten their sleeping bags. 

One wrote in their journal, “this is the last material in camp that we can use for food. We are badly broken down and all will go together. Who will be left to bury us with our departed comrades?"

Outside, bodies lay scattered in the snow..

On June 22nd, a rescue party finally arrived.

They cut through the canvas of the shelter, and light poured in.

Seven skeletal figures. Hollow eyes. Skin stretched over bone. Some couldn't lift their heads.

Greely slowly raised himself and squinted at the men standing over him.

"Here we are," he whispered. "Dying like men. Did what I came to do – beat the best record"

Another survivor groaned and begged them to go away. He wanted to be left alone to die in peace.

The doctor examined them. They were perhaps 48 hours from death.

As rescuers carried the survivors to the ships, others began the grim work of collecting the bodies outside.

They wrapped what remained of them in sheets. 

Of the 25 men who had sailed north three years earlier, only six would make it home alive.

---

ACT 6: THE KNIFE MARKS

The survivors returned to a hero's welcome.

Newspapers celebrated their miraculous rescue. The nation mourned the dead.

But within days, rumors began to spread.

Kislingbury's family demanded his body be exhumed.

When doctors unwrapped the remains, the celebration turned to horror.
 
Half his body was skeletonized. His arms and legs stripped of flesh - not torn, but cut.

These were not the marks of animals or decay.

They were knife cuts. Made by human hands.

Six other bodies were examined. The same marks. The same cuts.

The survivors claimed they had cut the flesh for fishing bait.

No one believed them.

The newspapers that had celebrated the survivors now turned on them.

Headlines screamed of cannibalism. Of savagery. Of men eating their dead.

The survivors denied everything.

And that denial raised a darker question.

Cannibalism for survival was understood - even accepted. Sailors had done it for centuries. The public would have forgiven desperate men who ate the already dead.

But the Greely survivors refused to admit what the knife marks made obvious.

Why?

Kislingbury had died with nothing in his stomach but seal skin

If food was being shared equally, why did he starve while others lived?

Some began to whisper a darker theory.

That an inner circle had formed around Greely. 
That they shared what little food remained among themselves. 
That they let the others — the men on the edges, the men who had fallen out of favor — weaken and die.

And then they ate them.

This was never proven. Greely refused to discuss it. The other survivors took their secrets to the grave

OUTRO

Despite the accusations, Adolphus Greely was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor and promoted to Major General.

The government that had abandoned him gave him its highest honor.

He lived until 1935.

He never spoke publicly about what happened at Cape Sabine.

Of the 25 men who ventured into the Arctic, 19 died - from starvation, from cold, from a bullet.

And perhaps from betrayal.

Some secrets are buried twice.
