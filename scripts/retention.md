# Retention Analysis

Detailed line-by-line retention analysis mapping YouTube Analytics retention curves to script content.

## Cross-Video Summary

### The 30-Second Calibration Window

Every video loses 25-35% of viewers in the first 30 seconds. This is unavoidable. What matters is what happens next:

| Video | Retention at 0:30 | Retention at 1:00 | 30-second drop |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Kabul | 66% | 41% | **-25%** (cliff) |
| Apollo | 71.5% | 56.1% | -15% (gradual) |
| Burke | 71.4% | 57.3% | -14% (gradual) |
| Soviets | 70.8% | 54.0% | -17% (gradual) |
| Boyd | 73.6% | 57.3% | -16% (gradual) |

**Kabul is the outlier.** It drops 25% between 0:30 and 1:00 vs ~15% for others. This is the "geopolitical context cliff" — too much setup before horror.

### Content That Causes Drops

| Content Type | Example | Typical Drop |
|--------------|---------|--------------|
| Historical/political context | Kabul's "Great Game" | -7% to -9% |
| "This is the dark story of..." | All videos | -5% to -8% |
| Story transition (new section) | Soviets "3. Soyuz 1" | -5% to -13% |
| Aftermath/consequences | Apollo ending | -5% to -7% |
| Intense emotional content | Komarov's final call | -4% |

### Content That Holds or Grows Retention

| Content Type | Example | Effect |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| Foreshadowing doom | "but this decision would come back to haunt them" | +0.5% to +1% |
| Character detail before death | Lemon on simulator | +0.8% |
| Villain cruelty (witnessed) | Boyd whipping | +1.1% |
| Timer/countdown tension | "only 20 seconds to locate the valve" | Flat (holds) |
| Listicle fresh start | Each new Soviet disaster | Creates new floor |

### The Listicle Advantage

Soviets has the best long-term retention despite a -28% cold open drop because:
- Each new story = fresh start
- Viewers think "what's #1?"
- Drop rate decreases per section: -8.2%/min → -2.1%/min → -1.6%/min

### Title Pre-Qualification

Boyd ("65 Sailors Eaten by Cannibals") has no cliff because the title filters viewers. Anyone who clicked already wants cannibalism. Compare to Kabul ("How the British Army Froze to Death") — viewers might expect something different.

## Video-by-Video Analysis

### Kabul (Worst Performer - 27% retention)

**The Cliff (0:27-0:36):**
| Time | Retention | Drop | Content |
|------|-----------|------|---------|
| 0:27 | 66.4% | -7.8% | "This is the dark story of the Army of the Indus" |
| 0:36 | 57.0% | **-9.4%** | Geopolitical context begins |

**What went wrong:** The -26% cliff between 0:27-0:54 happens during historical context about the "Great Game" between Britain and Russia. Viewers clicked for "froze to death in mountains" and got a geopolitics lecture.

**Retention stabilization:** After the cliff, Kabul actually holds well (57% → 27% over remaining 12 minutes = -2.5%/min). The problem is entirely front-loaded.

---

### Boyd (Best Performer - 1.6M views)

**No cliff pattern:**
| Time | Retention | Drop |
|------|-----------|------|
| 0:18 | 81.5% | -7.3% |
| 0:36 | 73.6% | -7.9% |
| 0:54 | 65.6% | -8.0% |
| 1:12 | 57.3% | -8.3% |

Drops are spread evenly (~8% each) rather than concentrated. Title "65 Sailors Eaten by Cannibals" pre-qualifies viewers.

**The whipping spike (4:48):** +1.1% retention when villain whips crew member. Witnessed cruelty holds attention.

---

### Soviets (600K views, ~52% retention)

**Cold open cliff (0:00-0:25):**
| Time | Retention | Drop | Content |
|------|-----------|------|---------|
| 0:12 | 89.3% | -9.5% | "Until 1967, every death in space was that of a Russian" |
| 0:25 | 70.8% | **-13.3%** | "3. Soyuz 1" — transition to first story |

**The Dying Accusation (3:29-3:42):**
| Time | Retention | Drop | Content |
|------|-----------|------|---------|
| 3:29 | 49.7% | -3.4% | "But in reality, the cosmonaut was very much awake" |
| 3:36 | 45.6% | -4.0% | Komarov crying in rage, cursing those who killed him |
| 3:42 | 43.5% | -2.1% | Wife on the call, asking what to tell children |

This is the most emotionally intense moment on the channel. It causes a -7.5% drop but the remaining viewers are committed.

**Section drop rates:**
- Soyuz 1: -8.2%/min
- Bondarenko: -2.1%/min
- Soyuz 11: -1.6%/min

Each section loses fewer viewers. Listicle structure filters casual viewers early.

---

### Apollo 1

**Cold open (0:00-0:58):**
| Time | Retention | Drop | Content |
|------|-----------|------|---------|
| 0:11 | 90.0% | -13.8% | Initial calibration |
| 0:29 | 71.5% | -8.5% | Transition to "In October 1957..." context |
| 0:58 | 56.1% | — | 44% gone by 1 minute |

**Mid-video recovery (4:24-5:52):**
| Time | Retention | Change | Content |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| 4:24 | 45.8% | +0.6% | "There's nothing wrong with this ship... but it makes me uncomfortable" |
| 4:53 | 46.1% | +0.8% | Grissom hung a lemon on the simulator |
| 5:22 | 47.8% | +0.2% | Crew enters command module |

Retention RISES during foreshadowing. These forward hooks work.

**End drop (9:17-9:47):** -12% in final 30 seconds during aftermath section. When story is clearly over, viewers leave.

---

### Burke & Wills

**Cold open subversion (0:00-0:38):**
| Time | Retention | Drop | Content |
|------|-----------|------|---------|
| 0:07 | 98.6% | — | "Through grit and determination..." |
| 0:15 | 87.3% | -11.3% | "But this is not one of those stories" |
| 0:23 | 77.1% | -10.1% | "This is a story of failure and incompetence" |

The subversion causes drops but filters to engaged audience.

**Flattest retention curve:** After cold open, drop rate is only -1% to -2%/min. Clear villain established early, steady escalation, no single climax moment.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Don't bury horror.** Kabul's -26% cliff happens because horror is teased but context comes first. Lead with visceral detail.

2. **Use the 30-second window wisely.** You will lose 30% no matter what. Make sure the remaining 70% know exactly what they're getting.

3. **Foreshadow constantly.** Apollo's mid-video retention RISE happens at foreshadowing moments. Every 60-90 seconds, tease what's coming.

4. **Consider listicle structure.** Soviets' drop rate decreases per section. Multiple stories = multiple chances to hook viewers.

5. **Limit context.** Kabul loses 9% during geopolitical explanation. Front-load one sentence of context, drip the rest.

6. **End at the climax.** Apollo loses 14% during the aftermath section. When the story is clearly over, viewers leave.

## Additional Insights from Data

### Relative Performance vs YouTube Average

All videos are **below YouTube average** for similar-length content (1.0 = average):

| Video | Avg Relative Performance |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Burke & Wills | 0.60 (best) |
| WW1 Tank | 0.56 |
| Massacre | 0.54 |
| Apollo | 0.48 |
| Soviets | 0.44 |
| Kabul | 0.44 |
| Boyd | 0.43 (worst relative) |

**Insight:** Boyd has 1.6M views but the *worst* relative retention. It went viral despite retention, not because of it. Likely driven by title/thumbnail/topic (cannibalism).

### End-of-Video Acceleration

Drop rate per segment (lower = flatter curve):

| Video | Drop 25-50% | Drop 50-75% | Drop 75-100% |
|-------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Burke & Wills | 0.19 | 0.13 | 0.29 |
| Kabul | 0.19 | 0.14 | 0.25 |
| Soviets | 0.54 | 0.25 | 0.28 |
| **Apollo** | **0.06** | **0.16** | **1.0** |

**Apollo has a massive problem:** Nearly flat until 75%, then **1.0 drop rate** in final quarter. The aftermath section (Gene Kranz quote, Joe Shea nervous breakdown) is killing retention. Cut or front-load that content.

### Traffic Source vs Watch Time

| Source | Avg Minutes/View |
|--------|------------------|
| End Screen | 10.09 |
| Notification | 6.0 |
| Suggested/Related | 4.9 |
| Subscriber | 3.91 |
| Search | 3.5 |

**Subscribers watch less than suggested traffic.** Optimize for algorithm (suggested) not notification clicks.

### Subscriber Jail

Videos with high subscriber % are stuck — algorithm stopped recommending them:

| Video | % from Subscribers |
|-------|-------------------|
| Kabul | 93.3% |
| Soviets | 64.3% |
| Boyd | 42.4% |
| Apollo | 10.4% |
| Massacre | 8.5% |
| Burke | 4.6% |
| WW1 Tank | 0% |

Kabul's 93% subscriber traffic means the algorithm gave up on it. The -26% cliff at 0:27 killed its reach.

### The 6-Minute Sweet Spot

WW1 Tank (6:36) has:
- Highest end retention (43%)
- Best relative performance (0.56)
- 0% subscriber traffic (100% organic)

Shorter videos retain better and get pushed by algorithm. Consider testing more 6-8 minute videos.

### Retention at Key Checkpoints

| Video | Duration | 25% | 50% | 75% | End |
|-------|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| WW1 Tank | 6:36 | 68.6% | 63.4% | 59.1% | 43.0% |
| Burke | 12:52 | 48.9% | 44.1% | 40.9% | 33.6% |
| Soviets | 10:36 | 52.1% | 38.7% | 32.4% | 25.3% |
| Massacre | 14:44 | 42.9% | 36.8% | 33.6% | 24.0% |
| Boyd | 11:28 | 46.2% | 42.0% | 33.9% | 22.2% |
| Apollo | 9:47 | 47.6% | 46.1% | 42.0% | 17.1% |
| Kabul | 14:50 | 30.1% | 25.4% | 21.8% | 15.6% |

## Methodology

### Step 1: Pull Fresh Data

```bash
cd analytics
node yt-analytics.js all --save
```

This fetches stats and retention curves for all videos and stores them in `analytics/data/analytics.db`.

### Step 2: Run Retention Analyzer on Each Video

Map retention curves to script content:

```bash
node analytics/retention-analyzer.js <video_id> <script_path>
```

To find video IDs:
```bash
sqlite3 data/analytics.db "SELECT video_id, title FROM videos"
```

Example:
```bash
node retention-analyzer.js aCqzUCTWm8I ../scripts/boyd.md
node retention-analyzer.js WhJszJmB5oU ../scripts/kabul.md
node retention-analyzer.js py0HRME1Npc ../scripts/soviets.md
```

The analyzer outputs:
- Detailed breakdown with timestamps mapped to script lines
- Biggest drops (sorted by severity)
- Retention holds (flat sections where viewers stayed)
- Section-by-section analysis

### Step 3: Cross-Video SQL Queries

Run these queries to compare videos:

**Relative performance vs YouTube average:**
```sql
SELECT
  v.title,
  v.duration,
  ROUND(AVG(r.relative_retention_performance), 3) as avg_relative_perf
FROM videos v
JOIN video_retention r ON v.video_id = r.video_id
GROUP BY v.video_id
ORDER BY avg_relative_perf DESC;
```

**Retention at key checkpoints (25%, 50%, 75%, end):**
```sql
SELECT
  v.title,
  v.duration,
  ROUND(r25.audience_watch_ratio * 100, 1) as ret_25pct,
  ROUND(r50.audience_watch_ratio * 100, 1) as ret_50pct,
  ROUND(r75.audience_watch_ratio * 100, 1) as ret_75pct,
  ROUND(r100.audience_watch_ratio * 100, 1) as ret_end
FROM videos v
JOIN video_retention r25 ON v.video_id = r25.video_id AND r25.elapsed_ratio = 0.25
JOIN video_retention r50 ON v.video_id = r50.video_id AND r50.elapsed_ratio = 0.50
JOIN video_retention r75 ON v.video_id = r75.video_id AND r75.elapsed_ratio = 0.75
JOIN video_retention r100 ON v.video_id = r100.video_id AND r100.elapsed_ratio = 1.0
ORDER BY ret_end DESC;
```

**Drop rate per segment (find accelerating drops):**
```sql
SELECT
  v.title,
  ROUND((r25.audience_watch_ratio - r50.audience_watch_ratio) * 100 / 25, 2) as drop_25_50,
  ROUND((r50.audience_watch_ratio - r75.audience_watch_ratio) * 100 / 25, 2) as drop_50_75,
  ROUND((r75.audience_watch_ratio - r100.audience_watch_ratio) * 100 / 25, 2) as drop_75_100
FROM videos v
JOIN video_retention r25 ON v.video_id = r25.video_id AND r25.elapsed_ratio = 0.25
JOIN video_retention r50 ON v.video_id = r50.video_id AND r50.elapsed_ratio = 0.50
JOIN video_retention r75 ON v.video_id = r75.video_id AND r75.elapsed_ratio = 0.75
JOIN video_retention r100 ON v.video_id = r100.video_id AND r100.elapsed_ratio = 1.0
ORDER BY drop_75_100;
```

**Biggest single-point drops across all videos:**
```sql
WITH retention_with_prev AS (
  SELECT
    r.video_id,
    v.title,
    r.elapsed_ratio,
    r.audience_watch_ratio,
    LAG(r.audience_watch_ratio) OVER (PARTITION BY r.video_id ORDER BY r.elapsed_ratio) as prev_ratio
  FROM video_retention r
  JOIN videos v ON r.video_id = v.video_id
)
SELECT
  title,
  ROUND(elapsed_ratio * 100) as pct_through,
  ROUND((prev_ratio - audience_watch_ratio) * 100, 1) as drop_pct
FROM retention_with_prev
WHERE prev_ratio IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY (prev_ratio - audience_watch_ratio) DESC
LIMIT 15;
```

**Traffic source breakdown (subscriber jail detection):**
```sql
SELECT
  v.title,
  SUM(CASE WHEN t.source_type = 'SUBSCRIBER' THEN t.views ELSE 0 END) as sub_views,
  SUM(CASE WHEN t.source_type = 'YT_SEARCH' THEN t.views ELSE 0 END) as search_views,
  SUM(CASE WHEN t.source_type = 'RELATED_VIDEO' THEN t.views ELSE 0 END) as suggested_views,
  SUM(t.views) as total_views,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN t.source_type = 'SUBSCRIBER' THEN t.views ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / SUM(t.views), 1) as sub_pct
FROM videos v
JOIN video_traffic_sources t ON v.video_id = t.video_id
GROUP BY v.video_id
ORDER BY sub_pct DESC;
```

**Average watch time by traffic source:**
```sql
SELECT
  source_type,
  SUM(views) as total_views,
  ROUND(SUM(estimated_minutes_watched) / SUM(views), 2) as avg_min_per_view
FROM video_traffic_sources
WHERE views > 10
GROUP BY source_type
ORDER BY avg_min_per_view DESC;
```

### Step 4: Interpret Results

**What to look for:**

1. **Cliff vs gradual drop** — A cliff (>10% single drop) indicates a specific problem. Gradual drops are normal.

2. **Where cliffs happen** — Map the timestamp to script content. Is it context? Transition? Slow section?

3. **Drop rate acceleration** — If drop_75_100 >> drop_25_50, the ending is weak. Content after climax kills retention.

4. **Relative performance** — Below 0.5 means worse than half of similar-length YouTube videos. Target 0.6+.

5. **Subscriber %** — Above 80% means algorithm gave up. Video needs better first 30 seconds to escape subscriber jail.

6. **Traffic source watch time** — Suggested/related viewers watch longer than subscribers. Optimize for algorithm, not notifications.

### Step 5: Update This Document

After analyzing a new video:
1. Add its line-by-line breakdown to the Video-by-Video Analysis section
2. Update the cross-video comparison tables
3. Note any new patterns discovered
