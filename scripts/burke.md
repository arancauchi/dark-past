For many, explorers are heroes who brave the unknown. 

Through grit and determination, they walk into darkness to find light on the other side.

But this is not one of those stories.

This is a story of failure and incompetence.

Of a man whose desire for fame and fortune, led to the deaths of seven men, wasting away in the desert until disease and exhaustion killed them.

This is the dark story of the Burke and Wills Expedition


In 1853, an Irish soldier named Robert Burke migrated to Australia and joined the Police Force.

His charisma saw him swiftly promoted and Burke took up the coveted position of magistrate in the colony of victoria. 

A quick-tempered and arbitrary man with a desire for fame and distinction, his mannerisms were eccentric and his rulings were arbitrary. Locals referred to him as a daredevil, with a reckless streak.

It was considered a poor reflection as a gentleman that at age 39, he had not yet found a wife. Burke unsuccessfully attempted to win the affection of a local theatre girl but she refused his advances.
 
Still spurned from his rejection and with nothing to lose he was determined to make a name for himself. 

In 1860, an opportunity presented itself that would, in Burke’s eyes, elevate him to the level of wealth and status that he so desperately craved.

The government of South Australia was offering a 2000 pound reward for the first man to cross the continent of Australia south to north, a distance of over 2000 miles

The goal of the expedition was to discover new lands in the harsh interior of the continent and to open the way for a telegraph to be installed that would connect Australia with the Dutch east Indies, and then on to europe.

Nominating himself to lead the expedition, he charmed those in powerful positions into believing that he was the best candidate.

He had no prior experience in exploration, having never ventured far into the wilderness. 

Quarrelsome in nature, Burke also lacked the temperament of a good leader,

He was completely unfit to command an expedition.

Oblivious to these shortcomings, the Expedition Committee placed its full trust in Burke. A letter from the committee, stated:

“The Committee is fully aware of the difficulty of the Country you are called on to traverse …“

“[we] entrust you with the largest discretion…”

This was the first in a series of mistakes that would doom the expedition from the beginning.

The committee also selected William Wills, a 27 year old surveyor to be third in command and responsible for surveying the newly discovered land.

A bright and inquisitive man, Wills was the opposite to Burke in every way. 

He would prove to be one of the few competent men on the expedition.

Making haste to organise the effort, Burke gathered supplies and recruited 16 men to join him on the long march.

The expedition carried with it a large amount of equipment, including unnecessary and cumbersome items such as a solid oak table and a chinese gong, packed onto lumbering wagons. 

The expedition left the city of Melbourne in the colony of Victoria on August 20 1860.

Their goal was to reach the Gulf of Carpentaria, in the tropical north of Australia

The party’s progress was incredibly slow, travelling only 3 miles on the first day.

After 2 months, the expedition had only travelled several hundred miles, through a relatively flat and inhabited country.

Frustrated by the slow progress and Burke’s routine berating and beatings for their perceived misbehaviour, the men were demoralised further.

Rather than trying to boost the morale of his party, Burke fired 13 of the expedition’s men, and re-hired 8 unskilled labourers from different towns as he passed through them. 

This eroded the competence of the expedition. 

In the town of Kinchega in western New South Wales, the expedition’s second in command and their only surgeon resigned in disgust, after arguing with Burke over his lack of care for the camels. 

The expedition was starting to fall apart.

To make matters worse, Burke discovered that another expedition, lead by the explorer John Stuart had departed from Adelaide in South Australia, hoping to cross the continent first.

This news devastated Burke, as Stuart was a well regarded and efficient explorer; his own party was only managing a speed of 2 miles per hour. 

Stuart would surely beat him in the race to cross the continent at this pace.

Acting on this, Burke decided to split the group, taking the strongest horses and seven of the fittest men and one camel driver to ride ahead to a place called Coopers Creek, the farthest limit of northern expansion by europeans.

Upon reaching the creek, the plan was to camp for several months to wait for the rest of the expedition to catch up and for the weather to cool before continuing their journey. 

With the threat of victory being snatched away from him, Burke grew impatient, and after only one week, decided to split the party again. 

Burke and Wills, along with two other men Gray and King continued north on December 16, the height of summer in Australia, leaving four men, under the command of William Brahe at the Coopers Creek campsite. 

Burke’s inexperience caused him to overestimate his abilities and underestimate how long the journey would take to reach the northern coast and return.

The men left behind were instructed to wait for three months, and if Burke did not return, leave for the south.

Wills secretly instructed the Brahe party to wait 4 months instead, as he had determined that Burke had incorrectly interpreted the maps.

Burke and Wills encountered temperatures exceeding a scorching 120 fahrenheit or 50 degrees celsius in the shade. 

Travelling through the oppressive heat, in conditions that we can scarcely imagine, the party moved north, across the desert.

After several exhausting weeks, the party reached a mangrove swamp that blocked their path forward.

This was the Flinders River delta, a vast tropical wetland that was difficult to cross.

They could taste the salty water of the ocean and could see the tide rising and falling within the swamp, but as hard as they tried, they found the route impassable.

They were only a few dozen miles from the coast, their final destination.

But 15 miles into the swampland, they were forced to turn back.

The agony of this decision must have weighed heavily on Burke, but he knew that time and their rations were running out.

It had taken them two months to reach this far, and the men had consumed over 2/3rds of their food.

Having not waited for the Fall as originally planned, their situation compounded as the monsoon season had begun, even after leaving the swamp, the men began to struggle in the muddy terrain, further slowing their progress. 

Several camels began to falter, and had to be shot, but their emaciated corpses proved slim fare for the men. 

As time wore on, they began to abandon their equipment as the pack animals fell and on April 10, their only horse Billy, was shot and eaten.

Soon after, Both Burke and Gray came down with dysentery.

The ill-tempered Burke believed that Gray was faking the illness, and when he caught Gray sneaking food from one of his packs, he beat the man severely.

By April 8, Gray could barely walk, and on April 17 he died.

Little is known of the nature of Gray’s death, but it is believed that Burke had severely wounded the man, who was already weak from illness.

The three remaining men buried Gray in a shallow unmarked grave and continued south

After another 2 weeks of travelling, the men finally stumbled back to Coopers Creek

The camp was deserted. 

With no way of knowing how close the men were, the Brahe party had left without them only hours earlier. 

The campfire was still smouldering

The men collapsed to their knees and wept.

After some time, the men spotted a tree with markings on it, engraved into the trunk was that day’s date and the word DIG.

Excavating the ground near the tree, they found a small cache of supplies and a letter addressed to the men. 

It explained that the Brahe party could no longer wait, 

Scurvy had set in amongst the men.

Although only a few hours behind, the Burke party knew that in their deteriorated state of health they would be unable to catch up. 

Realising the severity of the situation, Burke, Wills and King changed course, setting off for a distant cattle station in south australia, 150 miles southwest, the closest point of civilization.

Before departing, Burke wrote a letter detailing their destination burying it in the same place the supplies had been. 

They did not leave any new engravings on the tree to indicate that they had ever returned to Coopers Creek. 

This would prove to be another fatal mistake.

As Burke, Wills and King struggled through the desert they followed the river downstream to the southwest.. 

Their speed was slow, managing only five miles per day.

After their last camel became stranded in the river, they shot and killed it.

Now with no pack animals, the men could no longer carry enough water for them to leave the river and complete their overland journey through the desert.

Suffering from malnutrition, the men encountered indigenous people who offered them roots and plants in exchange for some sugar.

Unknown to the men, one of the plants, called nardoo, was sapping their body of strength.

Consuming the nardoo raw caused a severe vitamin deficiency, even though they were eating food, their bodies grew weaker.

After several days of slow progress, Wills must have realised that their chances of survival were slim. 

He returned to the Coopers Creek campsite to deposit his journal containing his maps and observations of the expedition in the supply cache in the hopes that their sacrifice would not amount to nothing.

While he was away, Burke, who had become increasingly paranoid in his delirious state, shot one of the indigenous men helping them, causing the whole tribe to flee.

Burke was heard by Wills to bitterly curse Brahe, for failing to leave them enough supplies or any pack animals.

By June 1861, with Wills rejoining Burke and King, the men’s pace had slowed to a crawl, starvation had set in.

Suffering from exhaustion and not wanting to burden the others, Wills insisted that the other two go on and leave him at a waterhole to die.

He wrote a letter addressed to his father, and passed it to King for safekeeping, in it he said:

“These are probably the last lines you will ever get from me. We are on the point of starvation…”

In the letter, Wills stated that he had no faith in god to save him, and that he had accepted his fate.

The two men continued on, leaving Wills to die.

After struggling for nine months, watching the expedition crumble before his eyes, with no one else to blame, Burke lay down for the final time, dying only two days after Wills. 

This left King alone, in the vast Australian desert.


Soon after leaving Coopers Creek, the Brahe party encountered the lumbering wagon convoy that was attempting to reach the base camp at coopers creek. 

The convoy had also suffered, they had been attacked by local tribes, and 3 of the party had died on the slow march north.

With a lingering sense of guilt, Brahe made the decision to return to Coopers Creek to see if Burke’s party had made it back to the camp. 

He suspected that he had left too soon, and that the struggling men may be waiting for his return.

After retracing his steps, Brahe returned to the coopers creek camp a week later.

They found it deserted, with no evidence that the men had ever returned..

Not thinking to check if the cache of supplies had been touched, the men assumed that Burke and Wills had not made it back. 

The Brahe party left the camp for a second time and returned southward, in the hopes that Burke and Wills would follow their path back to civilization.

After six months of receiving no word from the expedition, the media began to question the whereabouts of the party.

With mounting public pressure, several rescue efforts set out from Melbourne to find the lost expedition.

Continuing north and searching for several months along the Flinders River, the rescue party made a startling discovery.

They met a group of indigenous people, travelling with them, was a white man clothed in rags, riddled with disease.

Calling to the man, the rescue surveyor, Edwin Welch asked if the man was from the Burke and Wills expedition.

In a hoarse voice, he confirmed that he was John King.

Asked of the whereabouts of the other men, he replied:
'Dead, both dead, long ago'
King fell to the ground and wept bitterly.
____________________________________________________________________________
In total Burke and Wills were in the wilderness for 10 months. Having not accomplished the crossing, their main contribution was the maps and journal that Wills had the foresight to place back in the cache at Coopers Creek for the rescue parties to find.

Despite the difficulty of the task at hand, one of the rescue parties, while searching for Burke and Wills, accomplished the crossing of Australia from North to South, in just 9 months.

They received a 2000 pound bounty for their efforts as the first men to do so.


The tragedy of the Burke and WIlls story lies in the near misses and how easily mistakes made could have been avoided. 

In a cruel twist of irony, Burke achieved the level of fame he so desired in the abject failure of the expedition.
