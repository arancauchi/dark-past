INTRO

On the seventh day, the survivors held a vote.

Twenty-seven people remained on the raft.

Twelve were too weak to survive.

So the others seized them — one by one — and threw them into the sea. Not for food. They had plenty of corpses for that.

They killed them for the wine.

By then, the deck was slick with blood. They'd been eating the dead for days. Bodies lay in piles, half-butchered in the sun, swarming with flies.

Fifteen would survive. A hundred and thirty-five would not.

But they weren't shipwrecked. They were abandoned.

One man put them on that raft. And when it became a burden, he cut the ropes and rowed away.

ACT 1: ABANDONED

His name was Hugues Duroy de Chaumareys — a captain who hadn't commanded a ship in twenty years. He ran the Medusa onto a reef thirty miles from shore. Four hundred people, six lifeboats, and a makeshift raft that was never meant to carry anyone.

The officers and aristocrats took the boats. Everyone else — a hundred and fifty soldiers, sailors, and one woman — was told to board the raft.

By the time the last one climbed on, they were standing waist-deep in the ocean, the salt stinging their skin, the raft groaning under the weight.

The plan was for the lifeboats to tow them thirty miles to shore. But within hours, the men in the lifeboats were exhausted. The raft was too heavy.

If it sank, all those desperate people would swarm the lifeboats.

Chaumareys didn't hesitate. Cut the ropes.

One by one, the lifelines were severed — each snap a death sentence for the people on the raft.

A captain is supposed to be the last man off his ship. Chaumareys was in the first boat. As they rowed away, he sat with his back to the raft. He never looked back. Not once.

The people on the raft watched in confusion as the boats grew smaller and smaller.

Then confusion turned to panic.

Men screamed curses at the lifeboats and begged them to return, but the distance only grew.

Some leapt into the waves and tried to swim after them, only to vanish within seconds, swallowed by the indifferent sea.

150 people with almost no food and a single barrel of wine. Thirty miles from shore.

They'd been left to die.

ACT 2: PANIC

As night fell, another storm rolled in.

Waves swept across the deck, dragging men into the ropes and under the black water

People clung together and prayed.

By dawn, twenty-five were dead.

The survivors told themselves they would be rescued. 

The lifeboats must have reached shore by now.

But help didn’t come.

The second night adrift on the raft was worse.

By now, the survivors had determined that the center of the raft was the only safe place. It was higher, more stable, further from the waves.

But there wasn't room for everyone.

The naval officers claimed the center.

The infantry soldiers refused to yield.

Shoving quickly turned into punching and a full-scale battle erupted in the darkness - men slashing blind, screaming, stumbling over bodies.

Men were thrown overboard. Others were beaten until they stopped moving.

When the sun finally  rose, bodies lay tangled in the ropes, slick with blood, rolling with each swell.

But the killing wasn't over.

Some soldiers broke into the wine barrel. Drunk and despairing, they grabbed axes and started hacking at the ropes holding the raft together, attacking anyone who tried to stop them.

The passengers - civilians caught between the factions - watched in horror as the raft tore itself apart.

By the end of the third day, only 67 people were still alive.

And they were starving.

The survivors attempted to fish, bending their belt buckles into hooks. 

They caught nothing.

Others chewed on leather straps, linen shirts, even the cork from empty bottles. It wasn’t enough.

ACT 3: HUNGER

In most survival stories, cannibalism comes after weeks of starvation. 

On the raft of the Medusa, it took three days.

The bodies of the dead lay on the raft, bloated and pale in the sun, flies crawling over their faces.

One by one, the survivors began to cut.

At first, they dried the flesh in the sun to make it easier to stomach. 

Later, they stopped bothering.

In the words of one survivor: "Those whom death had spared fell upon the dead bodies and cut off pieces, which some instantly devoured."

On the fourth day, a small miracle occurred. 

A school of flying fish passed over the raft, dozens landed on the deck and were scooped up by desperate hands.

They made a fire inside an empty barrel and cooked what they'd caught.

But there wasn’t enough fish to go around.

So they mixed the fish with human flesh.

The wine was now strictly rationed.

Two soldiers were caught boring a hole in the barrel, stealing extra for themselves.

They were executed immediately and thrown overboard.

On the raft of the Medusa, stealing wine was a crime worse than eating the dead.

ACT 4: THE VOTE

On the seventh day, the officers gathered in the center of the raft.
They looked at the 27 people still alive and assessed the situation.
Fifteen were strong enough to survive—if rescue came soon.
The other twelve were wounded, delirious, or dying. They wouldn’t last more than a few days.
But they were still drinking the wine. If they kept rationing it to all 27, everyone would be dead within days.

If they stopped sharing with the twelve weakest, the remaining fifteen might survive another week.

Long enough, perhaps, for a ship to find them.

There was a debate. Some argued for mercy - let the weak die in peace.

Others argued there was no time. The weak might drink more wine in their final hours. They might attract sharks with their bleeding wounds.

A decision was made and the twelve were seized and dragged to the edge of the raft.

Some were too weak to resist. Others fought, screaming, clawing at the men who grabbed them.

It made no difference.

They were thrown into the sea.

Among them was the only woman on the raft. She had survived the storm, the battle, the starvation. She had been thrown overboard once before and dragged back to safety.

This time, no one saved her.

In the space of an hour, the survivors murdered twelve of their own.

They told themselves it was necessary. That it was survival.

But they had crossed a line that could never be uncrossed.

---

ACT 5: RESCUE

For six more days, the fifteen survivors drifted.

They huddled under a makeshift tent, fashioned from the sail, hiding from the sun that blistered their skin.

They ate what flesh remained. They rationed the last of the wine by the mouthful.

On the morning of the thirteenth day, a sailor crawled out of the tent to scan the horizon.

He saw a sail.

A ship - the Argus, one of the convoy that had left them behind - was heading straight for them.

The survivors crawled from the tent, weeping, waving their arms, clutching at each other.

When the Argus pulled alongside, the sailors on deck recoiled from the stench of rotting flesh and stared in horror at what remained: fifteen skeletal figures on a blood-stained raft, surrounded by human bones.

All fifteen were brought aboard.

Five died within weeks, their bodies too broken to recover.

Ten survived.

Those seventeen men who stayed with the wreck? A salvage crew found three of them still alive - fifty-four days later.

OUTRO

Captain Chaumareys made it safely to Senegal. He was court-martialed and found guilty of negligence. He was sentenced to just three years in a comfortable cell.

Then he walked free, returned to his estate, and lived another thirty years. He died in his bed at 86 - half a century after abandoning 150 people to die.

He never apologized. He never faced the families. He never spoke of the raft.

150 people boarded that raft.

15 were rescued.

And the man who cut the ropes? He outlived them all.
