COLD OPEN

November 1812. The Berezina River.

Napoleon's shattered Grande Armée scrambled to cross the river, fleeing the vengeful Russian Cossacks.

The desperate trampled the old and the young, clawing over the fallen to reach the other side.

Ten thousand people would die in the chaos.

ACT 1: THE TRAP

Five months earlier, Napoleon had marched into Russia with the largest army ever assembled. Six hundred and eighty thousand men.

Moscow was supposed to be the prize. Instead, they found it empty. The Russians had burned their own capital rather than surrender it.

Napoleon waited five weeks for a surrender that never came. Then winter arrived.

What followed was the deadliest march in military history.

The retreat began in October. By November, the army had lost everything — horses, supplies, men. Soldiers froze to death in their sleep. Others were picked off by Cossacks — Russian cavalry who hunted stragglers like animals.

Of the 680,000 who crossed into Russia, fewer than 50,000 were still alive.

And now they were trapped.

The Berezina lay ahead — normally frozen solid in November. But an unexpected thaw had broken the ice. It was impassable.

Behind them, three Russian armies were closing in.

ACT 2: THE BRIDGES

Weeks earlier, Napoleon had ordered the bridge-building equipment destroyed. Dead weight, he called it.

General Jean-Baptiste Eblé refused. He hid the forges, the tools, the coal. He knew the army might need them.

Now, at the Berezina, Eblé's disobedience was the only thing standing between fifty thousand people and annihilation.

His engineers waded into the river.

The water was chest-deep and freezing. Ice chunks drifted past their shoulders. They had no alcohol to warm them, no fire waiting on the bank.

For six hours, they stood in that water — hammering, lifting, holding the beams in place while their fingers went numb.

One by one, men collapsed and were dragged to shore. Some never got back up.

By nightfall on November 26th, two bridges stretched across the Berezina.

Of the four hundred engineers who went into that river, only forty would survive the week.

Eblé watched from the bank. He would be dead in five weeks.

But the bridges were open. The army could cross.

ACT 3: THE CROSSING

The fighting men crossed first. Napoleon and his guard. Then the infantry. Then the cavalry.

By nightfall on November 28th, most of the army was across.

The bridges stood empty.

Officers rode among the stragglers — the wounded, the civilians, the women and children who had followed the army from Moscow. They urged them to cross now, while the bridges were clear.

The stragglers refused.

It was a decision that would kill them.

The stragglers had built fires on the eastern bank. They were exhausted, frozen, half-starved. The bridge looked dark and treacherous. The western bank looked no better than where they sat.

They would cross in the morning, they said. When there was light.

So they stayed by their fires. Thousands of them. Waiting for dawn.

They had no way of knowing the Russians were hours away.

ACT 4: THE BURNING

Dawn came. And so did the Russians.

Artillery shells tore into the crowd on the eastern bank. Horses screamed. Wagons exploded. The stragglers who had waited for morning now stampeded toward the bridges.

Thousands of people crushed onto wooden planks built for dozens.

The crowd trampled men, women, and children underfoot. The strongest shoved the weakest off the sides and into the freezing water below. The ones who fell never came back up.

Wagons drove over the living and the dead alike. The bridges became slick with blood.

One soldier who survived later wrote: "It was with horror, but at that time with a dull, indifferent feeling, that I looked at the masses of horses and people which lay dead, piled high upon the bridge."

On the eastern bank, a young mother lay with a shattered thigh — a Russian shell had torn through her leg. She couldn't walk. She couldn't carry her four-year-old daughter. And the Cossacks were coming.

She untied the garter from her leg and wrapped it around her daughter's throat.

Then she lay down beside the body to die.

That morning, Eblé had no choice. The Russians were crossing. He ordered the bridges burned.

Ten thousand people were still on the other side.

The flames rose. The screaming began. Some tried to cross the burning wreckage. Most didn't make it.

The Cossacks swept through what remained.

OUTRO

Tens of thousands died at the Berezina River — soldiers and civilians alike.

General Eblé — the man who had saved them — died weeks later.

The word "Berezina" entered the French language that year. It means disaster.
