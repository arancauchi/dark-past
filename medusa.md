INTRO 

On the seventh day, the survivors held a vote.

Twenty-seven people remained on the raft. 

Twelve were too weak to survive.

So the others seized them - one by one - and threw them into the sea. Not for food. They had plenty of corpses for that.

They killed them for the wine.

This is the dark story of the Raft of the Medusa.

As always, viewer discretion is advised.

ACT 1: THE WRECK

One man put them on that raft. His name was Chaumareys.

In 1816, France's new king appointed him to command a convoy bound for Senegal off the coast of Africa.

Chaumareys hadn't captained a ship in twenty years. 

But he was nobility. 

That was enough to earn him the flagship Medusa.

The experienced officers despised him immediately

Chaumareys responded by humiliating them publicly by overruling their advice.

A decision that would kill 135 people.


  To prove himself, Chaumareys took a shortcut - a direct route hugging the African coast, through waters riddled with reefs.

  But he refused to consult his officers. Instead, he trusted a philosopher who flattered him and claimed to know the coast - but had never navigated a ship.

  The philosopher mistook a cloud for the coastline, and steered them straight into the most dangerous reef in the region.

On July 2nd, the Medusa struck the Bank of Arguin with a shuddering crack.

Over 400 people were stranded 30 miles off shore, with only six lifeboats.

---

ACT 2: ABANDONED

The crew tried everything to free the ship. They dumped cargo, emptied barrels and threw the heaviest items overboard.

The Medusa rose a few inches. 

It wasn’t  enough.

The ship's cannons might have made the difference but Chaumareys refused. He valued his guns more than his men.

Instead, he ordered them to build a crude platform of lashed masts and deck planks, barely twenty metres long to hold the supplies.

It was never meant to carry people.

But on the third night trapped on the reef, a storm struck. Thunderous waves and a howling wind filled the air. The hull began to split. Chaumareys panicked and gave the order to abandon ship.

The governor, the officers, and the aristocrats climbed into the lifeboats.

Everyone else - 150 soldiers, sailors, and one woman - was told to board the hastily built raft.

By the time the last one climbed on, they were standing waist-deep in the ocean, the salt stinging their skin, the raft groaning under the weight


The plan was for the lifeboats to tow them thirty miles to shore. But within hours, the men in the lifeboats were exhausted. The raft was too heavy.

If it sank, all those desperate people would swarm the lifeboats.

Chamareys ordered the ropes cut, one by one, the lifelines were severed.

As the raft drifted away, Chaumareys sat stiffly in the governor's boat, too cowardly to turn around.

The people on the raft watched in confusion as the boats grew smaller and smaller.

Then confusion turned to panic. 

Men screamed curses at the lifeboats and begged them to return, but the distance only grew. 

Some leapt into the waves and tried to swim after them, only to vanish within seconds, swallowed by the indifferent sea.

150 people with almost no food and a single barrel of wine. Thirty miles from shore.

They'd been left to die.

---

ACT 3: PANIC

As night fell, another storm rolled in.

Waves swept across the deck, dragging men into the ropes and under the black water

People clung together and prayed.

By dawn, twenty-five were dead.

The survivors told themselves they would be rescued. 

The lifeboats must have reached shore by now.

But help didn’t come.

The second night adrift on the raft was worse.

By now, the survivors had determined that the center of the raft was the only safe place. It was higher, more stable, further from the waves.

But there wasn't room for everyone.

The naval officers claimed the center.

The infantry soldiers refused to yield.

Shoving quickly turned into punching and a full-scale battle erupted in the darkness - men slashing blind, screaming, stumbling over bodies.

Men were thrown overboard. Others were beaten until they stopped moving.

When the sun finally  rose, bodies lay tangled in the ropes, slick with blood, rolling with each swell.

But the killing wasn't over.

Some soldiers broke into the wine barrel. Drunk and despairing, they grabbed axes and started hacking at the ropes holding the raft together, attacking anyone who tried to stop them.

The passengers - civilians caught between the factions - watched in horror as the raft tore itself apart.

By the end of the third day, only 67 people were still alive.

And they were starving.

The survivors attempted to fish, bending their belt buckles into hooks. 

They caught nothing.

Others chewed on leather straps, linen shirts, even the cork from empty bottles. It wasn’t enough.

---

ACT 4: HUNGER

In most survival stories, cannibalism comes after weeks of starvation. 

On the raft of the Medusa, it took three days.

The bodies of the dead lay on the raft, bloated and pale in the sun, flies crawling over their faces.

One by one, the survivors began to cut.

At first, they dried the flesh in the sun to make it easier to stomach. 

Later, they stopped bothering.

In the words of one survivor: "Those whom death had spared fell upon the dead bodies and cut off pieces, which some instantly devoured."

On the fourth day, a small miracle occurred. 

A school of flying fish passed over the raft, dozens landed on the deck and were scooped up by desperate hands.

They made a fire inside an empty barrel and cooked what they'd caught.

But there wasn’t enough fish to go around.

So they mixed the fish with human flesh.

The wine was now strictly rationed.

Two soldiers were caught boring a hole in the barrel, stealing extra for themselves.

They were executed immediately and thrown overboard.

On the raft of the Medusa, stealing wine was a crime worse than eating the dead.

ACT 5: THE VOTE

On the seventh day, the officers gathered in the center of the raft.
They looked at the 27 people still alive and assessed the situation.
Fifteen were strong enough to survive—if rescue came soon.
The other twelve were wounded, delirious, or dying. They wouldn’t last more than a few days.
But they were still drinking the wine. If they kept rationing it to all 27, everyone would be dead within days.

If they stopped sharing with the twelve weakest, the remaining fifteen might survive another week.

Long enough, perhaps, for a ship to find them.

There was a debate. Some argued for mercy - let the weak die in peace.

Others argued there was no time. The weak might drink more wine in their final hours. They might attract sharks with their bleeding wounds.

A decision was made and the twelve were seized and dragged to the edge of the raft.

Some were too weak to resist. Others fought, screaming, clawing at the men who grabbed them.

It made no difference.

They were thrown into the sea.

Among them was the only woman on the raft. She had survived the storm, the battle, the starvation. She had been thrown overboard once before and dragged back to safety.

This time, no one saved her.

In the space of an hour, the survivors murdered twelve of their own.

They told themselves it was necessary. That it was survival.

But they had crossed a line that could never be uncrossed.

---

ACT 6: RESCUE

For six more days, the fifteen survivors drifted.

They huddled under a makeshift tent, fashioned from the sail, hiding from the sun that blistered their skin.

They ate what flesh remained. They rationed the last of the wine by the mouthful.

On the morning of the thirteenth day, a sailor crawled out of the tent to scan the horizon.

He saw a sail.

A ship - the Argus, one of the convoy that had left them behind - was heading straight for them.

The survivors crawled from the tent, weeping, waving their arms, clutching at each other.

When the Argus pulled alongside, the sailors on deck recoiled from the stench of rotting flesh and stared in horror at what remained: fifteen skeletal figures on a blood-stained raft, surrounded by human bones.

All fifteen were brought aboard.

Five died within weeks, their bodies too broken to recover.

Ten survived.

---

OUTRO

Captain Chaumareys made it safely to Senegal. He was court-martialed and found guilty of negligence. He was sentenced to just three years in prison. Nobility has its privileges.

He served his time, returned to society, and lived another thirty years. He never spoke of the raft.

But the survivors did. Two of them wrote a book exposing everything - the incompetence, the abandonment, the vote. It became a national scandal that humiliated the new monarchy.

Two years later, artist Theodore Gericault unveiled his painting, The Raft of the Medusa. But even he sanitized it. No cannibalism. No murders. No vote.

150 people boarded that raft.

15 were rescued.

And of those who died, not all were taken by the sea.
