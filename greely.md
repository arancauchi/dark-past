Stranded in the Arctic — They Ate Each Other to Survive
GREELY EXPEDITION - DRAFT 2

---

COLD OPEN

When they exhumed the body of Frederick Kislingbury, his family expected to find a man who had starved to death in the Arctic.

what they uncovered was far more horrifying/what they found would haunt their dreams

Half his body had been stripped to the bone. His arms and legs carved clean - not by animals, but by a knife.

The official story was survival against impossible odds.

The knife marks told a different story.

This is the dark story of the Greely Expedition.

As always, viewer discretion is advised.

ACT 1: THE MISSION

In 1881, the United States sent 25 men to one of the most remote places on Earth.

Leading them was civil war veteran Lieutenant Adolphus Greely. 
Add character line about being shot and toughness

His second-in-command was Frederick Kislingbury. His closest friend. Frederick's wife had just died and he had signed on to escape his grief.

He would be one of the first to starve. And then they would eat him.

The men established Fort Conger, 600 miles from civilization.

Within weeks, Greely and Frederick clashed. Greely ordered him to be discharged for insubordination.
  Frederick rushed to catch the ship home, but it was already gone.

  He was trapped. Discharged but unable to leave. A ghost in his own expedition.

  For the next three years, he would hunt for the men who cast him out.

ACT 2: ABANDONED

A resupply vessel set out for Fort Conger but it hit an impenetrable wall of ice, the captain left a cache of supplies at Cape Sabine, 240 miles south, and turned back.

Two long years passed in the freezing dark.

In 1883, a second ship tried to reach them. 

The captain pushed too far into the ice. The floes closed around the hull like a fist.

Wood splintered. Water rushed in. The ship was crushed and swallowed by the Arctic Ocean.

All the supplies sank with it.

Back at `Fort Conger, nothing reached Greeley. No ship. No rescue. No word.

By August 1883, he understood: no one was coming/ By August 1883 he had lost all hope.

Their food was nearly gone. Their only hope was to march south to Cape Sabine, where supplies had supposedly been left.

240 miles through the Arctic. As winter approached. Better hook ending


ACT 3: THE SLOW DEATH

On August 9th, the 25 men abandoned Fort Conger and began the long walk south.
The journey nearly killed them before they arrived.

For weeks, they dragged boats across ice floes, battled freezing winds, watched the daylight disappear. When their boats became trapped, they drifted on the ice until currents finally carried them near Cape Sabine.

When they finally reached the supply cache in October, what they found crushed them.

A few crates. Enough food for a few weeks. Not nearly enough to survive the winter.

Greely rationed what little they had. Each day, portions grew smaller. Men's faces grew hollow.

They built a crude shelter from rocks and canvas, huddled together against temperatures that plunged to 40 below.

By January 1884, they were eating dog biscuits scraped from the bottom of crates. Then boiled leather straps. Then lichens scraped from rocks.

On January 18th, Sergeant William Cross collapsed and died - the first to succumb to scurvy and starvation.

Two men - George Rice and Joseph Ellison - volunteered to trek south to find another supply cache.

They found it. Four crates of preserved meat.

But on the return journey, Joseph's legs became so frostbitten that they were forced to abandon the meat in the snow, George using all his strength to carry Joseph back to the camp.

George went back to retrieve the meat.

He never returned.

Frederick watched as Greely's inner circle—the men who slept closest to him in the shelter—still had strength to move. To fish. To survive.

For three years, Frederick had hunted for them. Kept them fed when no one else could.

Now his hands were frostbitten. He couldn't hunt anymore.

And no one was feeding him.

He confronted Greely privately. He accused his oldest friend of favoritism. Of feeding some men while letting others starve.

Greely said nothing. He simply turned away.

After that night, Frederick was no longer welcome at the center of the shelter.

He began to unravel. The months of darkness, the hunger, the isolation—it broke something in him. He stopped responding to questions. When he spoke at all, it was only childlike muttering.

On June 1st, Frederick died. His stomach was empty. He had eaten nothing but indigestible seal skin for days.
His body was carried outside and left in the snow with the others.

That same week, others in the shelter were still catching shrimp.

But by the end of the month, half the expedition was dead.

The survivors had grown too weak to dig graves.

The corpses began to pile up.

But not everyone died of starvation.

ACT 4: THE EXECUTION

Charles Henry couldn't stop stealing.

He was caught again. And again. It didn’t matter, starvation made him desperate.

Greely issued a decree: anyone caught stealing food would be executed.

It wasn't a bluff.

The next day, Charles was caught stealing shrimp from the nets.

Greely didn't hesitate.

He ordered two men to take Charles away from the camp.

The others sat in silence, too weak to protest, too hungry to object.

A single gunshot echoed across the ice.

That night, two more men died of starvation.

Only seven survivors remained.

---

ACT 5: THE RESCUE

They lay in their shelter, too weak to move.

They had eaten everything. Moss. Candle wax. Animal droppings. Boiled seal skin. The leather from their boots.

Outside, bodies lay scattered in the snow - unburied, frozen, some for months.

On June 22nd, a rescue party finally arrived.

They cut through the canvas of the shelter, and light poured in.

The rescuers stared at what lay inside.

Seven skeletal figures. Hollow eyes. Skin stretched over bone. Some couldn't lift their heads.

Greely slowly raised himself and squinted at the men standing over him.

"Here we are," he whispered. "Dying like men."

Another survivor groaned and begged them to go away. He wanted to be left alone to die in peace.

The doctor examined them. They were perhaps 48 hours from death.

As rescuers carried the survivors to the ships, others began the grim work of collecting the bodies outside.

They wrapped them in sheets without looking too closely.

Of the 25 men who had sailed north three years earlier, only six would make it home alive.

ACT 6: THE KNIFE MARKS

The survivors returned to a hero's welcome.

Newspapers celebrated their miraculous rescue. The nation mourned the dead.

But within days, rumors began to spread.

Frederick Kislingbury's family demanded his body be exhumed.

When doctors unwrapped the remains, the celebration turned to horror.

Half his body was skeletonized. His arms and legs stripped of flesh - not torn, but cut.

These were not the marks of animals or decay.

They were knife cuts. Made by human hands.

Six other bodies were examined. The same marks. The same cuts.

The survivors claimed they had cut the flesh for fishing bait.

No one believed them.

The newspapers that had celebrated the survivors now turned on them.

Headlines screamed of cannibalism. Of savagery. Of men eating their dead.

The survivors denied everything.

And that denial raised a darker question.

Cannibalism for survival was understood - even accepted. Sailors had done it for centuries. The public would have forgiven desperate men who ate the already dead.

But the Greely survivors refused to admit what the knife marks made obvious.

Why?

Frederick had hunted for them for three years.

He died with nothing in his stomach but seal skin.

If food was being shared equally, why did he starve while others lived?

Some began to whisper a darker theory.

That an inner circle had formed around Greely. 
That they shared what little food remained among themselves. 
That they let the others — the men on the edges, the men who had fallen out of favor — weaken and die.

And then they ate them.

This was never proven. Greely refused to discuss it. The other survivors took their secrets to the grave

---

OUTRO

Despite the accusations, Adolphus Greely was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor and promoted to Major General.

The government that had abandoned him gave him its highest honor.

He lived until 1935.

He never spoke publicly about what happened at Cape Sabine.

Of the 25 men who ventured into the Arctic, 19 died - from starvation, from cold, from a bullet.

And perhaps from betrayal.

Some secrets are buried twice.
